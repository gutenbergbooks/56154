<h2 id="I">CHAPTER I<br />
A STRANGER COMES TO HASTINGS</h2></div>


<p>A horseman rode slowly out of a draw and
up a steep, lava-covered ridge, singing "The
Cowboy's Lament," to the disgust of his horse, which
suddenly arched its back and stopped the song in the
twenty-ninth verse.</p>

<p>"Dearly Beloved," grinned the rider, after he had
quelled the trouble, "yore protest is heeded. 'Th' Lament'
ceases, instanter; an' while you crop some of that
grass, I'll look around and observe th' scenery, which
shore is scrambled. Now, them two buttes over there,"
leaning forward to look around a clump of brush, "if
they ain't twins, I'll eat&mdash;"</p>

<p>He ducked and dismounted in one swift movement
to the vengeful tune of a screaming bullet over his
head, slapped the horse and jerked his rifle from its
scabbard. As the horse leaped down the slope of the
ridge there was no sign of any living thing to be seen
on the trail. A bush rustled near the edge of a draw,
a peeved voice softly cursed the cacti and Mexican
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
locust; and a few minutes later the shadow of a black
lava bowlder grew suddenly fatter on one side. The
cause of this sudden shadow growth lay prone under
the bulging side of the great rock, peering out intently
between two large stones; and flaming curiosity consumed
his soul. A stranger in a strange land, who
rode innocently along a free trail and minded his own
business, merited no such a welcome as this. His
promptness of action and the blind luck in that bending
forward at the right instant were all that saved his
life; and his celerity of movement spoke well for his
reflexes, for he had found himself fattening the shadow
of the bowlder almost before he had fully realized the
pressing need for it.</p>

<p>Minute after minute passed before his searching
eyes detected anything concerned with the unpleasant
episode, and then he sensed rather than saw a slight
movement on the mottled, bowlder-strewn slope of a
distant butte. A bush moved gently, and that was all.</p>

<p>To cross the intervening chaos of rocks and brush,
pastures and draws would take him an hour if it were
done as caution dictated, and by that time the chase
would be useless. So he waited until the sun was two
hours higher, pleasantly anticipating a stealthy reconnaissance
by his unknown enemy to observe the dead.
He had dropped into high grass and brush when he
left the saddle and there was no way that the marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>man
could be certain of the results of his shot except
by closer examination. But the man in ambush had no
curiosity, to his target's regret; and the target, despairing
of being honored by a visit, finally gave up the
vigil. After a silent interval a soft whistle from a
thicket, well back in a draw, caused the grazing horse
to lift his head, throw its ears forward and walk
sedately toward the sound.</p>

<p>"Dearly Beloved," said a low voice from the thicket,
"come closer. That was a two-laigged skunk, an' his
eyes are good. Likewise he is one plumb fine shot."</p>

<p>Ever since he had listened to the marriage ceremony
which had subjugated his friend Hopalong for the rest
of that man's natural life, the phrase "Dearly Beloved"
had stuck in his memory; and in his use of it
the words took the place of humorous profanity.</p>

<p>Mounting, he rode on again, but kept off all skylines,
favored the rough going away from the trail, and
passed to the eastward of all the obstructions he met;
and his keen eyes darted from point to point unceasingly,
not giving up their scrutiny of the surroundings
until he saw in the distance a little town, which he knew
was Hastings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the little cow-town of Hastings the afternoon sun
drove the shadows of the few buildings farther afield
and pitilessly searched out every defect in the cheap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and hastily constructed frame buildings, showed the
hair-line cracks in the few adobes, where an occasional
frost worked insidious damage to the clay, and drew
out sticky, pungent beads of rosin from the sun-bleached
and checked pine boards of the two-story
front of the one-story building owned and occupied by
"Pop" Hayes, proprietor of one of the three saloons
in the town. The two-story front of Pop's building
displayed two windows painted on the warped boards
too close to the upper edge, the panes a faded blue,
where gummy pine knots had not stained them yellow;
and they were framed by sashes of a hideous red.</p>

<p>Inside the building Pop dozed in his favorite position,
his feet crossed on a shaky pine table and his chair
tipped back against the wall. Slow hoof-beats, muffled
by the sand, sounded outside, followed by the sudden,
faint jingling of spurs, the sharp creak of saddle gear
and the soft thud of feet on the ground. Pop's eyes
opened and he blinked at the bright rectangle of sunny
street framed by his doorway, where a man loomed up
blackly, and slowly entered the room.</p>

<p>"Howd'y, Logan," grunted Pop, sighing. His feet
scraped from the table and thumped solidly on the
floor in time with the thud of the chair legs, and he
slowly arose, yawning and sighing wearily while he
waited to see which side of the room would be favored
by the newcomer. Pop disliked being disturbed, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
by nature he was one who craved rest, and he could
only sleep all night and most of the day. Rubbing the
sleep out of his eyes he yawned again and looked
more closely at the stranger, a quick look of surprise
flashing across his face. Blinking rapidly he looked
again and muttered something to himself.</p>

<p>The newcomer turned his back to the bar, took
two long steps and peered into the battered showcase
on the other side of the room, where a miscellaneous
collection of merchandise, fly-specked and dusty, lay
piled up in cheerful disorder under the cracked and
grimy glass. Staring up at him was a roughly scrawled
warning, in faded ink on yellowed paper: "Lean on
yourself." The collection showed Mexican holsters,
army holsters, holsters with the Lone Star; straps,
buckles, bone rings, star-headed tacks, spurs, buttons,
needles, thread, knives; two heavy Colt's revolvers,
piles of cartridges in boxes, a pair of mother-of-pearl
butt plates showing the head of a long-horned steer;
pipes, tobacco of both kinds, dice, playing cards, harmonicas,
cigars so dried out that they threatened to
crumble at a touch; a patented gun-sight with Wild
Bill Hickok's picture on the card which held it; oil,
corkscrews, loose shot and bullets; empty shells,
primers, reloading tools; bar lead, bullet molds&mdash;all
crowded together as they had been left after many pawings-over.
Pop was wont to fretfully damn the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and demand, peevishly, to know why "it" was always
the very last thing he could find. Often, upon these
occasions, he threatened to "get at it" the very first
chance that he had; but his threats were harmless.</p>

<p>The stranger tapped on the glass. "Gimme that
box of .45's," he remarked, pointing. "No, no; not
that one. This <i>new</i> box. I'm shore particular about
little things like that."</p>

<p>Pop reluctantly obeyed. "Why, just th' other day
I found a box of ca'tridges I had for eleven years; an'
they was better'n them that they sells nowadays. That's
one thing that don't spoil." He looked up with
shrewdly appraising eyes. "At fust glance I thought
you was Logan. You shore looks a heap like him:
dead image," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes? Dead image?" responded the stranger, his
voice betraying nothing more than a polite, idle curiosity;
but his mind flashed back to the trail. "Hum.
He must have a lot of friends if he looks like me," he
smiled quizzically.</p>

<p>Pop grinned: "Well, he's got some as is; an' some
as ain't," he replied knowingly. "An' lemme tell you
they both runs true to form. You don't have to copper
no bets on either bunch, not a-tall."</p>

<p>"Sheriff, or marshal?" inquired the stranger, turning
to the bar. "It's plenty hot an' dusty," he averred.
"You have a life-saver with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Might as well, I reckon," said Pop, shuffling across
the room with a sudden show of animation, "though
my life ain't exactly in danger. Nope; he ain't no
sheriff, <i>or</i> marshal. We ain't got none, 'though I ain't
sayin' we couldn't keep one tolerable busy while he
lived. I've thought some of gettin' th' boys together
to elect me sheriff; an' cussed if I wouldn't 'a' done it,
too, if it wasn't for th' ridin'."</p>

<p>"Ridin'?" inquired the stranger with polite interest.</p>

<p>"It shakes a man up so; an' I allus feels sorry for
th' hoss," explained the proprietor.</p>

<p>The stranger's facial training at the great American
game was all that saved him from committing a breach
of etiquette. "Huh! Reckon it does shake a man up,"
he admitted. "An' I never thought about th' cayuse;
no, sir; not till this minute. Any ranches in this country?"</p>

<p>"Shore; lots of 'em. You lookin' for work?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I reckon so," answered the stranger.</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't look out sharp you'll shore find
some."</p>

<p>"A man's got to eat more or less regular; an' cow-punchers
ain't no exception," replied the stranger, his
soft drawl in keeping with his slow, graceful movements.</p>

<p>Pop, shrewd reader of men that he was, suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that neither of those characteristics was a true index
to the man's real nature. There was an indefinable
something which belied the smile&mdash;the eyes, perhaps,
steel blue, unwavering, inscrutable; or a latent incisiveness
crouching just beyond reach; and there was a
sureness and smoothness and minimum of effort in the
movements which vaguely reminded Pop of a mountain
lion he once had trailed and killed. He was in the
presence of a dynamic personality which baffled and
disturbed him; and the two plain, heavy Colt's resting
in open-top holsters, well down on the stranger's
thighs, where his swinging hands brushed the well-worn
butts, were signs which even the most stupid
frontiersman could hardly overlook. Significant, too,
was the fact that the holsters were securely tied by
rawhide thongs, at their lower ends, to the leather
chaps, this to hold them down when the guns were
drawn out. To the initiated the signs proclaimed a
gunman, a two-gun man, which was worse; and a red
flag would have had no more meaning.</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Pop, smiling amiably, "as to work,
I reckon you can find it if you knows it when you sees
it; an' don't close yore eyes. I'll deal 'em face up, an'
you can take yore choice," he offered, wiping his lips
on the edge of the bar towel, both the action and the
towel itself being vociferously described by his saddle-sitting
friends as affectations, for everybody knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
that a sleeve or the back of a hand was the natural
thing. "Now, there's th' Circle S; but I dunno as they
needs any more men. They could get along with less
if them they has would work. Smith, of th' Long T,
over in th' southwest, could easy use more men; but
he's so close an' all-fired pe-nurious that I dunno as
he'd favor th' idear. He's a reg'lar genius for savin'
money, Smith is. He once saved a dollar out of three
cents, an' borrowed them of me to start with. Then
there's th' CL, over east in th' Deepwater Valley.
You might get something there; an' Logan's a nice
man to work for, for a few days. He allus gives his
men at least two hours sleep a night, averagin' it up;
but somehow they're real cheerful about it, an' they
all swears by him 'stead of at him. Reckon mebby it's
th' wages he pays. He's got th' best outfit of th' three.
But, lemme tell you, it's a right lively place, th' CL;
an' you don't have to copper <i>that</i>, neither. Th' cards
is all spread out in front of you&mdash;take yore choice an'
foller yore nat'ral bend."</p>

<p>"Logan," mused the stranger. "Didn't you say
something about him before?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I did," grunted Pop. "You've got a mem'ry near
as bad as Ol' Hiram Jones. Hiram, he once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought so," interposed the cow-puncher hastily.
"What kind of a ranch is th' CL?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was th' fust to locate in these parts, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
had its pick; an', nat'rally, it picked th' valley of th'
Deepwater. Funny Logan ain't found no way to make
th' river work; it wouldn't have to sleep at all, 'cept
once in a while in th' winter, when it freezes over for
a spell. It'd be a total loss then; mebby that's why he
ain't never tried.</p>

<p>"But takin' a second holt," he continued, frowning
with deep thought; "I dunno as I'd work for him, if I
was you. You looks too much like him; an' you got a
long life of piety an' bad whiskey ahead of you, mebby.
An', come to think of it, I dunno as I'd stay very long
around these parts, neither; an' for th' same reason.
Now you have a drink with me. It shore is th' hottest
spring I've seen in fifty year," he remarked, thereby
quoting himself for about that period of time. Each
succeeding spring and summer was to him hotter than
any which had gone before, which had moved Billy Atwood
to remark that if Pop only lived long enough he
would find hell a cool place, by comparison, when he
eventually arrived there.</p>

<p>"Sic 'em, Towser!" shrilled a falsetto voice from
somewhere. "I'll eat his black heart!" Then followed
whistling, clucking, and a string of expletives
classical in its completeness. "Andy wants a drink!
Quick!"</p>

<p>A green object dropped past the stranger's face,
thumped solidly on the pine bar, hooked a vicious-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
beak on the edge of the counter, and swore
luridly as its crafty nip missed the stranger's thumb.</p>

<p>The puncher swiftly bent his sinewy forefinger,
touched it with his thumb, and let it snap forward. The
parrot got it on an eye and staggered, squawking a
protest.</p>

<p>Pop was surprised and disappointed, for most strangers
showed some signs of being startled, and often
bought the drinks to further prove that the joke was
on them. This capable young man carelessly dropped
his great sombrero over Andrew Jackson and went
right on talking as though nothing unusual had occurred.
It appeared that the bird was also surprised
and disappointed. The great hat heaved and rocked,
bobbed forward, backward, and sideways, and then
slid jerkily along the bar, its hidden locomotive force
too deeply buried in thought and darkness to utter
even a single curse. Reaching the edge of the bar the
big hat pushed out over it, teetered a moment and then
fell to the floor, where Andrew Jackson, recovering his
breath and vocabulary at the same instant, filled the
room with shrill and clamorous profanity.</p>

<p>The conversation finished to his satisfaction, the
stranger glanced down at his boot, where the ruffled
bird was delivering tentative frontal and flank attacks
upon the glittering, sharp-toothed spur, whose revolving
rowel had the better of the argument. Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sensed the movement, side-stepped clumsily and cocked
an evil eye upward.</p>

<p>"You should 'a' taught him to swear in th' deaf an'
dumb alphabet," commented the puncher, grinning at
the bird's gravity. "Does he drink?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Try him, an' see," suggested Pop, chuckling. He
reached for a bottle and clucked loudly.</p>

<p>Andrew shook himself energetically, and then proceeded
to go up the puncher's chaps by making diligent
use of beak and claws. Reaching the low-hung belt,
he hooked his claws into it and then looked evilly and
suspiciously at the strange, suddenly extended forefinger.
Deciding to forego hostilities, he swung himself
upon it and was slowly lifted up to the bar.</p>

<p>Pop was disappointed again, for it was the bird's
invariable custom to deftly remove a portion of strange
forefingers so trustingly offered. He could crack nuts
in his crooked beak. Andy shook himself violently,
craned his neck and hastened to bend it over the rim of
the glass.</p>

<p>The stranger watched him in frank disgust and
shrugged his shoulders eloquently. "So all you could
teach him was vile cuss words an' to like whiskey,
huh?" he muttered. "He's got less sense than I
thought he had," he growled, and, turning abruptly,
went swiftly out to his horse.</p>

<p>Pop stared after him angrily and slapped the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
savagely. Emptying the liquor upon the floor, he shuffled
quickly to the door and shook his fist at the departing
horseman.</p>

<p>"Don't you tell Logan that <i>I</i> sent you!" he shouted
belligerently.</p>

<p>The stranger turned in his saddle, grinning cheerfully,
and favored his late host with a well-known, two-handed
nose signal. Then he slapped the black horse
and shot down the street without another backward
glance.</p>

<p>Pop, arms akimbo, watched him sweep out of sight
around a bend.</p>

<p>"Huh!" he snorted. "Wonder what yo're doin'
down here? Galivantin' around th' country, insultin'
honest, hard-workin' folks, an' wearin' two guns, low
down an' tied! I reckon when you learns th' lay of th'
country, if you stays long enough, you'll wind up by
joinin' that gang up in th' Twin Buttes country. I allus
like to see triggers on six-shooters, <i>I</i> do." He had not
noticed the triggers, but that was no bar to his healthy
imagination. Shuffling back to his seat, he watched the
indignant Andy pecking at a wet spot on the floor.</p>

<p>"So you didn't chaw his finger, huh?" he demanded,
in open and frank admiration of the bird's astuteness.
"Strikes me you got a hull lot of wisdom, my boy.
Some folks says a bird ain't got no brains; but lemme
tell you that you've got a danged good instinct."</p>

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY</h2></div>


<p>Meanwhile the stranger was loping steadily
eastward, and he arrived at the corral of the
CL ranch before sundown, nodding pleasantly to the
man who emerged from it: "Howd'y," he said. "I'm
lookin' for Logan."</p>

<p>The CL man casually let his right hand lay loosely
near the butt of his Colt: "Howd'y," he nodded.
"Yo're lookin' right at him."</p>

<p>"Do you need any more punchers?" asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>"H'm," muttered the foreman. "Might use one.
If it's you, we'll talk money on pay-day. I'll know
more about you then."</p>

<p>A puncher, passing the corral, noticed the two guns,
frowned slightly and entered the enclosure, and leaned
alertly against the palisade, where a crack between two
logs served him as a loophole.</p>

<p>The two-gun man laughed with genuine enjoyment
at the foreman's way of hiring men. "That's fair,"
he replied; "but what's th' high an' low figgers? I
like to know th' limit of any game I sets in."</p>

<p>Logan shrugged his shoulders. "Forty is th' lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
I'd offer a white man; an' he wouldn't draw that more'n
a month. Any man as ain't worth more is in our way.
It's a waste of grub to feed him. Th' sky is th' high
limit&mdash;but you've got to work like h&mdash;l to pass th'
clouds."</p>

<p>"I'm some balloon," laughed the stranger.
"Where's the grub shack?"</p>

<p>"Hold on, young man! We ain't got that far, yet.
Where are you from, an' what have you been doin'
with yore sweet young life?"</p>

<p>The stranger's face grew grave and his eyes narrowed
a trifle.</p>

<p>"Some folks allow that's a leadin' question. It ain't
polite."</p>

<p>"I allow that, too. An' I'm aimin' to make it a
leadin' question, 'though I ain't lackin' in politeness,
nor tryin' to rile you. You don't have to answer. Th'
wide world, full of jobs, is all around you."</p>

<p>The newcomer regarded him calmly for a moment,
and suddenly smiled.</p>

<p>"Yore gall is refreshin'," he grinned. "I'm from
th' Bar-20, Texas. I'm five feet ten; weigh a hundred
an' sixty; blue eyes, brown hair; single an' sober, now
an' always. I writes left-handed; eat an' shoot with
both; wears pants, smokes tobacco, an' I'm as handy a
cow-puncher as ever threw a rope. Oh, yes; modesty
is one of my glarin' faults; you might say my only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
glarin' fault. Some people call me 'Dearly Beloved';
others, other things; but I answer to any old handle
at grub pile. My name is Johnny Nelson an' I never
had no other, 'cept 'Kid,' to my friends. I'm thirty
years old, minus some. An'&mdash;oh, yes; I'm from th'
Tin Cup, Montanny. I get things twisted at times, an'
this shore looks like one of 'em."</p>

<p>"Of course," grunted Logan, his eyes twinkling.
"That's easy. Th' two ranches, bein' so close together,
would bother a man. Sorta wander off one onto th'
other, an' have to stop to think which one yo're workin'
for. They should mark th' boundaries plainer&mdash;or
put up a fence."</p>

<p>Johnny flushed. "I allus say Bar-20 when I speaks
off-hand an' have more on my mind than my hair. That
man in th' corral divides my attention. He flusters me.
You see, I was cussed near born on th' old Bar-20&mdash;worked
there ever since I was a boy. That crack in
th' wall is big enough for two men to use. Thank you,
friend: you near scared me to death," he chuckled as
the suspicious watcher emerged and started for the
bunk-house.</p>

<p>"You look so much like th' boss, I couldn't help
watchin' you," grinned the puncher over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Logan grunted something, and then nodded at the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Cut it loose," he encouraged. "I don't get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
chance like this every day, my observant friend. I
allus reckoned I could cover ground purty well, but I'll
be hanged if I can spread myself so I can work in Texas
an' Montanny at th' same time. You got me beat from
soda to hock. Yo're goin' to be a real valuable man,
which I can see plain. Comin' down to cases, you ain't
really a cow-puncher; yo're a whole cussed outfit, barrin'
th' chuck waggin an' th' cook. I have great hopes
for you. Tell me about it."</p>

<p>Johnny swung a leg over the pommel and smiled
down at the man who was grinning up at him.</p>

<p>"Of course," he replied, "it ain't none of yore business,
which we both admits. We just can't do any
business on any other understandin'. But I waives
that: an' here goes.</p>

<p>"I worked with the Bar-20 till Buck went up to run
th' Tin Cup. Cow-thieves kept him so busy that our
new foreman went up to help him. He stayed there.
Red got lonesome for Hoppy, and shore follered.
Skinny was lost without th' pair of 'em, so he up an'
follered Red. Lanky, missin' Skinny, got plumb restless
an' takes th' trail a month later. Then a railroad
crosses our ranch an' begins layin' out two towns, so
Pete gets on his hind laigs, licks a section boss, an'
chases after Lanky. I'm gettin' lonesomer and lonesomer
all th' time, but I manages to stick on th' job by
pullin' leather, because I was drawin' down a foreman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
pay. That ranch had five foremen in three months; an'
they was all good ones, 'cept, mebby, me. But when I
saw barbed wire on th' sidin', fence posts along th'
right of way, sheep on th' hills, an' plows plumb ruinin'
good grass land, I hunts up that same section boss,
licks him again in mem'ry of Pete, packed my war bag,
an' loped north after Pete. Th' old ranch has gone
plumb to h&mdash;l!"</p>

<p>Logan, a scowl on his face, rubbed the butt of his
Colt and swore softly. "It'll be that way all over th'
range, some day. Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, up on th' Tin Cup, Buck got married.
Hoppy had been before he left Texas. Tex Ewalt's
gettin' th' disease now. He quit drinkin', card playin',
an' most everything worth doin'. He ain't fit company
for a sheep no more. Not knowing he was framin' up
th' play, I loafed along an' didn't propose quick
enough. That's once more he saved my life. Th'
air's plumb full of matrimony on th' Tin Cup. There
was two black-eyed sisters in Twin River&mdash;Lanky
takes one an' Skinny th' other. They tossed for choice.
Pete, who was matrimony galled, raised such a ruction
at th' doin's that there just wasn't no livin' with him.
His disposition was full of sand cracks, an' he'd ruther
fight than eat. We pulled off a couple of hummers, me
an' him.</p>

<p>"Every time I'd try to get some of my friends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
go to town for a regular, old time, quiet evenin' I
found I didn't have no friends left; an' th' wimmin all
joined hands an' made me feel like a brand-blotter. I
was awful popular, <i>I</i> was! Ever try to argue with a
bunch of wimmin? It's like a dicky bird chirpin' in a
cyclone; he can't even hear hisself!</p>

<p>"We had a cook once, on th' Bar-20, that would run
an' grab a gun if he saw a coyote ten miles away.
That's th' way they acted about me, all but Mary, who
is Mrs. Hopalong. She had th' idea she could make
me all over again; an' I wouldn't a-cared if she hadn't
kept tryin' all th' time. At first all my ex-friends would
sneak around an' sort of apologize to me for th' way
their wives acted; an' then, d&mdash;d if they didn't get to
sidin' in with th' wives! Whenever I wandered into
sight th' wimmin would cluck to their worse halves, an'
scold me like I was a chicken hawk. An' I had lots of
advice, too. It was just like my shadow, only it worked
nights, too. Nobody called me 'Kid' or 'Johnny' no
more. Them days was past. I was <i>that</i> Johnny Nelson:
know what I mean?</p>

<p>"Red did sneak off to town with me twice&mdash;an'
drank ginger-ale, an' acted about as free an' happy
as a calf with a red-hot old brandin' iron over his
flank. He wouldn't play faro because he only had two
dollars, an' reckoned he might need it for somethin'
before pay-day come around again. That was on pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>-day,
too! An' that was Red, <i>Red Connors</i>! Great
polecats! Why, there was a time when Red&mdash;oh,
what's th' use!</p>

<p>"Hopalong&mdash;you call him that now when his wife's
around!&mdash;he was something on some board, or something;
an' he said he had to set a good example.
Wouldn't even play penny ante! Think of it! There
was a time when a camel, with all his stummicks, an' a
Gatlin' gun on his back, couldn't a follered th' example
<i>he</i> set. I was just as happy as a bobcat in a trap&mdash;an'
about as peaceful. There wasn't nothin' I could
do, if I stayed up there, but get married; an' that was
like hangin' myself to keep from gettin' shot. Then,
one day, Mrs. Hopalong caught me learnin' William,
Junior, how to chew tobacco. As if a five-year-old kid
hadn't ought to get some manly habits! An', say!
You ought to see that kid! If he won't bust his daddy's
records for h&mdash;l-raisin' I miss my guess; unless they
plumb spoils him in th' bringin' up. Well, she caught
me learnin' him; but like th' boundin' jack rabbit I'm
hard to catch. An' here I am."</p>

<p>Logan's grin threatened his ears. "I'm glad of it,"
he laughed. "There's something in yore face I like&mdash;mebby
it's th' tobacco. Thanks; I will; I'm all out
of it right now. How did you come to pick us out to
land on? Pop recommend us to you?"</p>

<p>"Now don't blame me for that," rejoined Johnny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
"Anyhow, he took it back later. As to stoppin' in this
country, th' idea suddenly whizzed my way at them
twin buttes north of town. I like this range. Things
sort of start themselves, an' there's music in th' air.
It reminds me of th' Bar-20, in th' old days. A man
won't grow lazy down here; he'll keep jumpin'. An' I
found a trace of lead at that funny-lookin' ridge east
of them freak buttes; but I couldn't find where it come
from. If I had, I'd 'a' salted th' mine with a Sharp's
Special. You see, I'm ambidextrous&mdash;ain't that a
snorter of a word?&mdash;an' when I ain't punchin' cows
with one hand, I'm prospectin' with th' other. Somebody
down here is plumb careless with his gun&mdash;an'
he's got a good gun, too. He's too cussed familiar on
short acquaintance. But it's too bad I look like you,
'though that's why I'm offerin' you my valuable services."</p>

<p>"I reckon it's a cross I got to stagger under," replied
Logan, the smile gone from his face; "but I'll
try to live it down. An' somehow my trusting nature
leans toward you, though it shouldn't. Yo're a two-gun
man, which acts like yeast in th' suspicious mind.
I've seen 'em before; an' you looks most disconcertin'
capable. Then you says Bar-20, an' Hopalong, an'
Red Connors, an' th' others. You talk like you knew
'em intimate. I've heard of 'em, all of 'em. Like
th' moon, you shine in reflected light. I've heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
you, too; I'm surprised you ain't in jail. Now then:
If you are <i>that</i> Johnny Nelson, of <i>that</i> outfit, an' you
can prove it, I yearns to weep on yore bosom; if you
ain't, then I'll weep on yore grave. Th' question of
identity is a ticklish one. It makes me that nervous I
want to look under th' bed. As a two-gun man, unknown,
yo're about as welcome on this ranch, right
now, as a hydrophoby skunk; but as Johnny Nelson,
of that old Bar-20, yo're worth fifty a month to me, as
a starter, with ten dollars extra for each six-gun. But
I've just simply got to have proof about who you are,
an' where you come from. Let's pause for an inspiration."</p>

<p>Johnny grinned. "I don't blame you; for I've had
a sample of something already. An' I've got a tail holt
on an inspiration. You hunt up that pen you've had
since Adam was a boy; find th' ink that you put away
last summer so you'd know where it was when you
wanted it in a hurry; an' then, in thirty minutes' hard
labor you'll have something like this:</p>

<p class="i2 p2">"'Mr. William Cassidy, Senior, Tin Cup,
Twin Rivers, Montanny: Dear Sir: A nice
lookin' young man wants to take seventy dollars a
month away from me, as a starter. His undershirt
is red, with th' initials "WC" worked near
th' top buttonhole in pretty blue silk thread. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
wants Pete to send him that eight dollars that
Pete borrowed to buy William, Junior, a .22 rifle
to bust windows with. Tell Red his pants wear
well. Does William, Junior, chew tobacco? He
has been shot at already. What is this young
man's name? Did he work on th' old Bar-20
with you? Yours truly, Logan.'</p>

<p class="p2">"Exhibit 1: Th' red undershirt. Hoppy has even
more of 'em than Buck, 'though Rose is comin' along
fast. Mary branded 'em all so she could pick 'em out
of th' wash. It helped me pick this one off th' clothes-line,
because me an' Hoppy wears th' same size. Exhibit
2: A scab on my off ear. William, Junior, was
shootin' at a calf an' I stopped him. He's a spunky
little cuss, all right; but they'll spoil him yet. An' Pete
never did have any sense, anyhow. Th' poor kid is
shootin' blanks now, an' blamin' it on th' gun. An' it
was a mean trick, too. That hit about th' tobacco will
get under Hoppy's scalp&mdash;he'll answer right quick.
You might say to tell William, Junior, that I ain't
forgot my promise, an' that I'll send him a shotgun
just as soon as he gets big enough to tote it around."</p>

<p>"I'll shore send it," laughed Logan, whose imagination
was running wild. "But outside of the identity you
suits me right down to the ground. If Hopalong Cassidy
says yo're all right I'll back you to my last dollar. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mentioned hearin' music in th' air. It was a tunin' up.
Will you stay for th' dance?"</p>

<p>"Sweet bells of joy!" exclaimed Johnny, leaving
the saddle as though shot out by a spring. "From
wimmin', barb wire, sheep an' railroad towns, to this!
I can go to town with th' boys once more! I can cuss
out loud an' swagger around regardless! An' some
mangey gent is careless with his gun! You can lose
me just as easy as a cow can lose a tick. I feel right
at home."</p>

<p>"All right, then. Strip off yore saddle and turn that
fine cayuse loose," replied Logan, chuckling. He
hoped that he might be able to coax the new man to
swap horses. "Th' cook's callin' his hogs, so let's go
feed."</p>

<h2 id="III">CHAPTER III<br />
THE WISDOM OF THE FROGS</h2></div>


<p>For two weeks Johnny rode range with the outfit
and got familiar with the ranch. There was one
discovery which puzzled him and seemed to offer an
explanation for the shot on the trail: He had found
the ruins of a burned homestead on the northern end
of the ranch and he guessed that it had been used by
"nesters;" and the evicted squatters might have mistaken
him for Logan. His thoughts constantly turned
to the man who had shot at him, and to the country
around Twin Buttes; and often he sat for minutes,
stiffly erect in his saddle, staring at the two great buttes,
eager to explore the country surrounding them and to
pay his debt.</p>

<p>From where he rode, facing westward, he could see
the Deepwater, cold at all seasons of the year. Flowing
swiftly, it gurgled and swished around bowlders of
lava and granite and could be forded in but one place
in thirty miles, where it spread out over a rocky, submerged
plateau on the trail between the CL and Hastings,
and where it grew turbulent and frothy with
wrath as it poured over the up-thrust ledges. Along
its eastern bank lay the ranch, in the valley of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Deepwater, and beyond it a short distance stood the
Barrier, following it mile after mile and curving as it
curved.</p>

<p>The Barrier, well named, was a great ledge of limestone,
up-flung like a wall, sheer, smooth and only occasionally
broken by narrow crevices which ran far back
and sloped gradually upward, rock-strewn, damp, cool,
and wild. It stretched for miles to Johnny's right and
left, a wall between the wild tumble of the buttes and
the smooth, gently rolling, fertile plain, which, beginning
at the river, swept far to the eastward behind him,
where it eventually became lost in the desert wastes.
On one side of the rampart lay the scurrying river and
the valley of the Deepwater, rolling, sparsely timbered
and heavily grassed, placid, peaceful, restful; on the
other, seeming to leap against the horizon, lay the
grandeur of chaos, wild and forbidding.</p>

<p>Highest above all that jagged western skyline, shouldering
up above all other buttes and plateaus, Twin
Buttes peremptorily challenged attention. Remarkably
alike from all sides, when viewed from the CL ranch-house
they seemed to have been cast in the same mold;
and the two towering, steep-sided masses with their
different colored strata stood high above the Barrier
and the chaos behind it like concrete examples of
eternity.</p>

<p>Twin Buttes were the lords of their realm, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a realm it was! Around them for miles great buttes
rose solidly upward, naked on their abrupt sides except
for an occasional, straggling bush or dwarfed pine or
fir which here and there held precarious footholds in
cracks and crevices or on the more secure placement
of a ledge. Deep draws choked with brush lay between
the more rolling hills along the eastern edge of the
watershed where the Barrier stood on guard, and rich
patches of heavy grass found the needed moisture in
them. On the slopes of the hills were great forests of
yellow pine, a straggling growth of fir crowning their
tops. Farther west, where the massive buttes reared
aloft, the deep canyons were of two kinds. The first,
wide, with sloping banks of detritus, were covered with
pine forests and torn with draws; the second, steep-walled,
were great, narrow chasms of wind- and water-swept
rock, bare and awe inspiring. They sloped upward
to the backbone of the watershed and had humble
beginnings in shallow, basin-like arroyos, which gradually
became boxes in the rock formation as the level
sloped downward.</p>

<p>But the chaos stopped at the Barrier, which marked
the breaking of stratum upon stratum of the earth's
crust. Ages ago there had been a mighty struggle here
between titanic forces. To the west the earth's crust,
battered into buttes, canyons, draws, and great plateaus,
had held out with a granite stubbornness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
strength defying the seething powers below it; but the
limestone and the sandstone, weaker brothers, betrayed
by the treachery of the shales, had given under
the great strain and parted. The western portion had
held its own; but the eastern section had dropped down
into the heaving turmoil and formed the floor of the
valley of the Deepwater. And as if in compensation,
the winds of the ages, still battling with the stubborn
buttes, had robbed them of soil and deposited it in the
valley.</p>

<p>One evening, when Johnny rode in for supper, Logan
met him at the corral and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Shake, Nelson," he smiled. "Crosby went to
town today and brought me a letter from th' Tin Cup.
After you have fed up, come around to my room an'
see me. I want to hold a right lively pow-wow with
you."</p>

<p>"Shore enough!" laughed Johnny, an expectant grin
on his face. "Bet he laid me out from soda to hock,
tail to bit, th' old pirate!"</p>

<p>"Well, you've got a terrible reputation, young man.
Go an' feed."</p>

<p>Johnny was the first at the table that night, and the
first away from it by a wide margin. Rolling a cigarette,
he lit it and hastened to Logan's quarters, where
he found the foreman contentedly smoking.</p>

<p>"Come in an' set down," invited the foreman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
"We're goin' to do a lot of talkin'; it's due to be a long
session. There's th' letter."</p>

<p>Johnny read it:</p>

<p class="i2 p2">"Mr. John C. Logan. Dear Sir: I take my pen
in hand to answer your letter of recent date. Pete
paid Red the 8 dollars to even up for the pants,
but nobody paid me for the shirt, ask him why
he took the best one. William, Junior, hates tobacco.
We was scared hed die. He swears most
suspicious like Johnny Nelson. I hid the gun
in the storeroom. It cost me $12 damages the
first week, besides a calf. Can you use Pete Wilson?
I'll pay 1/2 his wages the first 6 months. I'd
ruther have boils than him. He's worse since
Johnny left. Don't let Johnny come north again,
and God have mercy on your soul. He's easy
worth $70, if you are in trouble. If you ain't in
trouble he'll get you there. Excuse pensil. Yours
truly, Wm. Cassidy, Senior. P. S. His old job is
waiting for him and he can have the shirt. It
must be near wore out anyhow. Tell him it only
costs 2 cents to write me a letter, but I bet hell
freezes before I get one. William, Junior, raised
the devil when he missed Johnny. Yes, he worked
on the Bar-20. If he sends the kid a shotgun, I'll
come down and bust his neck. Excuse pensil."</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Johnny looked steadily out of the door, ashamed to
let Logan see his face, for homesickness is no respecter
of age. He gulped and felt like a sick calf. Logan
smiled at him through the gloom and chuckled, and at
the sound the puncher stiffened and turned around with
a fine attempt at indifference.</p>

<p>The foreman nodded at the letter. "Keep it if you
wants. They must be a purty fine bunch, them fellers.
I never knowed any of 'em, but I've heard a lot about
'em. 'Youbet' Somes used to drop in here once in a
while, an' he knowed 'em all. I ain't seen Youbet for
quite a spell now."</p>

<p>Johnny managed to relax his throat. "Finest outfit
that ever wore pants," he blurted. "Youbet's dead.
Went out fightin' seven sheep-herders in a saloon, but
he got three of 'em. Hoppy met up with two of th'
others th' next summer an' had words with 'em. Th'
other two are still livin', I reckon." He thought for a
moment and growled: "It's th' wimmin that done it.
You wouldn't believe how that crowd has changed!
D&mdash;n it, why can't a man keep his friends?"</p>

<p>The foreman puffed slowly and made no answer
beyond a grunt of understanding. Johnny folded the
letter carefully and put it in his pocket. "What's th'
cow business comin' to, anyhow?" he demanded.
"Wimmin, railroads, towns, sheep, wire&mdash;" he despaired
of words and glared at the inoffensive corral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"An' rustlers," added Logan.</p>

<p>"They're only an incident," retorted Johnny. "They
can be licked, like a disease; but th' others&mdash;oh, what's
th' use!"</p>

<p>"Yo're right," replied Logan; "but it's the rustlers
that have got me worried. I ain't thinkin' about th'
others very much, yet."</p>

<p>Johnny turned like a flash. He wanted action, action
that would take his thoughts into other channels. The
times were out of joint and he wanted something upon
which to vent his spleen. He had been waiting for that
word to come from Logan, waiting for days. And he
had a score of his own to pay, as well.</p>

<p>"Rustlers!" he exulted. "I knowed it! I've knowed
it for a week, an' I'm tired of ridin' around like a
cussed fool. I know th' job <i>I</i> want! What about
'em?"</p>

<p>Logan closed the door by a push of his foot, refilled
and lit his pipe, and for two hours the only light the
room knew was the soft glow of the pipe and the firey
ends of the puncher's cigarettes, while Logan unfolded
his troubles to eager ears. The cook sang in the kitchen
as he wrestled his dishes and pans, and then the noise
died out. Laughter and words and the thumping of
knuckles on a card table came from the bunkroom, and
grew silent. A gray coyote slid around the corral,
sniffing suspiciously, and at some faint noise faded into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the twilight, and from a distant rise howled mournfully
at the moon. From a little pond in the corral came the
deep-throated warning of the frogs, endless, insistent,
untiring: "Go 'round! Go 'round! Knee deep! Knee
deep! Go 'round! Go 'round! Go 'round!"</p>

<p>The soft murmur of voices in the foreman's room
suddenly ceased, and a chair scraped over the sandy
floor. The door creaked a protest as it swung slowly
inward and a gray shape suddenly took form against
the darkness of the room, paused on the threshold and
then Logan stepped out into the moonlight and knocked
his pipe against his boot heel. A second figure emerged
and joined him, tossing away a cigarette.</p>

<p>The foreman yawned and shook his head. "I didn't
know how to get 'em, Nelson," he said again. "I
wasn't satisfied to stop th' rustlin'. I wanted to wipe
'em out an' get back my cows; but I didn't have men
enough to go about it right, an' that cussed Barrier
spoiled every plan."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the puncher. "But it's funny that none
of th' boys, watchin' nights, never got a sign of them
fellers. They must be slick. Well, all right; there'll
have to be another plan tried, an' that'll be <i>my</i> job. I
told you that I found traces of lead over near Twin
Buttes? Well, I'm goin' prospectin', an' try to earn
that seventy dollars a month. Any time you see a
green bush lyin' at th' foot of th' Barrier, just north of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Little Canyon, keep th' boys from ridin' near there that
same night. I may have some business there an' I shore
don't want to be shot at when I can't shoot back. It's
too cussed bad Hoppy an' Red are married."</p>

<p>Logan laughed: "Then don't you make that mistake
some day! But what about that feller Pete Wilson that
Cassidy wants to get rid of?"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about me gettin' married!"
snorted Johnny. "I saw too much of it. An' as for
Pete, he's too happy wallerin' in his misery. Anyhow,
he wouldn't leave Hoppy an' th' boys; an' they
wouldn't let him go. You couldn't drag him off the
Tin Cup with a rope. Then we've settled it, huh?
I'm to leave you tomorrow, with hard words?"</p>

<p>"Hard words ain't necessary. I know every man
that works for me an' they'll stick, an' keep their
mouths shut. Now, I warn you again: I wouldn't give
a dollar, Mex., for yore life if you go through with
your scheme. An' it'll be more dangerous because you
look like me, an' have worked for me. You can give
it up right now an' not lose anythin' in my opinion.
Think it over tonight."</p>

<p>Johnny laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well," said the foreman, "I'm lettin' you into a
bad game, with th' cards stacked against you; but I'll
come in after you when you say th' word; an' th' outfit'll
be at my back."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know that," smiled Johnny. "I'll be under a
handicap, keepin' under cover an' not doin' any
shootin'; but If I make a gun-play they'll begin to do
some figgerin'. Gosh, I'm sleepy. Reckon I'll hunt
my bunk. Good night."</p>

<p>"No gun-play," growled Logan. "You know what
I want. How many they are, where they round up my
cows, an' when they will be makin' a raid, so I can get
'em red-handed. <i>We</i>'ll do the fightin'. Good night."</p>

<p>They shook hands and parted, Johnny entering the
house, Logan wandering out to the corral, where he
sat on a stump for an hour or more and slowly smoked
his pipe. When he finally arose he found that it
was out, and cold, much to his surprise.</p>

<p>"Go 'round! Go 'round!" said the pond. "Better
go 'round! Go 'round!"</p>

<p>Logan turned and sighed with relief at a problem
solved. "Yo're a right smart frog, Big Mouth," he
grinned. "'Go 'round' is th' medicine; an' I've got
th' doctor to shove it down their throats! There's a
roundup due in th' Twin Buttes, an' it's started now."</p>

A FEINT</h2></div>


<p>Pop Hayes sighed, raised his head and watched
the door as hoof-beats outside ceased abruptly.</p>

<p>"Dearly Beloved!" said an indignant voice. "If
you tries any more of yore tricks I'll gentle you with
th' butt of a six-gun, you barrel-bellied cow! Oh, <i>that's</i>
it, huh? I savvy. You yearns for that shade. Go to
it, Pepper."</p>

<p>"'Dearly Beloved'!" snorted Pop in fine disgust.
"You'd think it was a weddin' tower! Who th' devil
ever heard a cayuse called any such a name as that?"
he indignantly demanded of Andrew Jackson; but Andrew
paid no attention to him. The bird's head was
cocked on one side and he sidled deliberately toward
the door.</p>

<p>A figure jumped backward past the door, followed
by a pair of hoofs, which shot into sight and out again.
Andy stopped short and craned his neck, his beady eyes
glittering with quick suspicion.</p>

<p>"I can shore see where you an' me has an argument,"
said the voice outside. "If you make any more
plays like that I'll just naturally kick yore ribs in.
G'wan, now; I ain't got no sugar, you old fool!" And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the smiling two-gun man stepped into the room, with a
wary and affectionate backward glance. "Hello, Pop!"
he grinned. "You old Piute, you owes me a drink!"</p>

<p>"Like h&mdash;l I do!" retorted Pop with no politeness,
sitting up very straight in his chair.</p>

<p>"You shore do!" rejoined Johnny firmly. "Didn't
you tell me that th' CL was a nice ranch to work for?"</p>

<p>"Yo're loco! I didn't say nothin' of th' kind!"
snapped Pop indignantly. "I said they'd work you
nigh to death; <i>that's</i> what I said!"</p>

<p>"Oh; was that it?" asked Johnny dubiously. "I
ain't nowise shore about it; but we'll let it go as it lays.
Then I owe you a drink; so it's all th' same. Yo're a
real prophet."</p>

<p>Pop hastily shuffled to his appointed place and performed
the honors gracefully. "So you went an' got
a job over there, huh?" he chuckled. "An' now yo're
all through with 'em? Well, I <i>will</i> say that you stuck
it out longer than some I knows of. Two weeks with
Logan is a long time."</p>

<p>"It's so long that I've aged considerable," admitted
Johnny, smiling foolishly. "But I'm cured. I'm cured
of punchin' cows for anybody, for a while. Seems to
me that all I've done, all my life, was to play guardian,
to fool cows. I've had enough for a while. Th' last
two weeks plumb cured me of punchin'."</p>

<p>He looked down and saw Andy, feathers ruffled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
squaring off for another go at the spur, stooped suddenly,
scooped the squawking bird into his hand, tossed
it into the air, caught it, and quickly shoved it headfirst
into a pocket. Andy swore and backed and wriggled,
threatened to eat his black heart and to do other
unkind and reprehensible things. Giving a desperate
heave he plopped out of the pocket and struck the floor
with a thud. Shaking himself, he screamed profane
defiance at the world at large and then made his clumsy
and comical way up the chaps and finally roosted on the
butt of one of the six-guns, where he clucked loudly and
whistled.</p>

<p>Johnny gave a peculiar whistle in reply, and almost
instantly Pop let out a roar and jumped toward the
door to drive back a black horse that was coming in.</p>

<p>"Get out of here!" he yelled pugnaciously. Pepper
bared her teeth and slowly backed out again. Turning,
Pop glared at the puncher. "Did you see that? Mebby
Andy ain't th' only animal that drinks," he jabbed,
remembering a former conversation.</p>

<p>Johnny laughed and scratched the bird, which stood
first on one foot and then on the other, foolish with
ecstatic joy.</p>

<p>Pop regarded the bird with surprise. "Well, if that
don't beat all!" he marveled. "There ain't another
man can do that, 'cept me, an' get off with a whole
hand. Andy'll miss you, I reckon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"He won't miss me much," responded Johnny, comfortably
seating himself in Pop's private chair. "I
ain't leavin' th' country."</p>

<p>"You won't have to. There's other ranches, where
they treats punchers better'n cows. There's another
chair, over there."</p>

<p>"No more ranches for me," replied Johnny, ignoring
the hint. "I'm through punchin', I tell you. I'm
goin' to play a while for a change."</p>

<p>"Gamblin's bad business," replied Pop, turning to
get the cards.</p>

<p>"Mebby some gamblin' is; but there's some as
ain't," grinned Johnny. "I ain't meanin' cards."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Pop, disappointed. "What you mean&mdash;shootin'
craps?"</p>

<p>"Nope; I'm goin' prospectin'; an' if that ain't gamblin'
then I never saw anythin' that was."</p>

<p>Pop straightened up and stared. "Prospectin?" he
demanded, incredulously. "Regular prospectin'? Well,
I'll be cussed! If yo're goin' to do it around
here, lemme tell you it won't be no gamble. It'll be a
dead shore loss. A flea couldn't live on what you'll
earn on that game in this country."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't aimin' to support no flea, unless Andy
leaves me one," laughed Johnny, again scratching the
restless bird. "But I'm tired of cows, an' I might as
well amuse myself prospectin' as any other way. I like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
this country an' I'm goin' to stay a while. Besides,
when I was a kid I shore wanted to be a pirate; then
when I got older I saw a prospector an' hankered to be
one. I can't be a pirate, but I'm goin' to be a prospector.
When my money is gone I'll guard cows again."</p>

<p>"Lord help us!" muttered Pop. "Yo're plumb
loco."</p>

<p>"How can I be plumb an' loco at th' same time?"</p>

<p>"Andy!" snapped Pop. "Come away from there!
Lord knows you ain't got no sense, but there ain't no
use riskin' yore instinct!"</p>

<p>Johnny laughed. "Leavin' jokes aside, me an' Pepper
are goin' off by ourselves an' poke around pannin'
th' streams an' bustin' nuggets off th' rocks till we get
a fortune or our grub runs out. We can have a good
time, an'&mdash;hey! You got any fishhooks?"</p>

<p>"Fishhooks nothin'!" snorted Pop. "Lot of call <i>I</i>
got for fishhooks. Why, I ain't heard th' word for ten
years. Say!" he grinned sheepishly. "Mebby you'll
get lonesome. Now, if we went off together, with some
fishhooks&mdash;but, shucks! I can't leave this here business."</p>

<p>Johnny hid his relief. "That's th' worst of havin'
a business. You certainly can't go off an' let everythin'
go to smash."</p>

<p>"Cuss th' luck!" growled Pop. "Gosh, I'm all het
up over it! I ain't done no fishin' since I was a kid, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
there must be lots of trout in these streams." Then he
brightened a little. "But I dunno. You look too
cussed much like Logan to be real comfortable company
for <i>me</i>. I reckon I'll pay attention to business."</p>

<p>Johnny showed a little irritation. "There you go
again! You do a lot of worryin' about my looks. If
they don't suit you, start right in an' change 'em!"</p>

<p>"There <i>you</i> go!" snapped Pop disgustedly. "On
th' prod th' first thing! You'd show more common
sense if <i>you</i> did some of th' worryin'. But then, I
reckon it'll be all right if you does yore prospectin' an'
fishin' south of here."</p>

<p>"No, sir! I'm goin' to do it north of here, in th'
Twin Buttes country."</p>

<p>Pop's expression baffled description, and his Adam's
apple bobbed up and down like a monkey on a stick.
"Good Lord! You stick to Devil's Gap, an' south of
there!"</p>

<p>Johnny's eyes narrowed and he sat up very straight.
"This is a free country an' I goes where I please. It's
a habit of mine. I said north, an' that's where I'm
goin'. I wasn't so set on it before; but now I'm as set
as a Missouri mule."</p>

<p>Pop growled. "There ain't no chance of you havin'
<i>my</i> company; an' you leave th' name an' address of
yore next of kin before you starts."</p>

<p>Johnny laughed derisively. "I ain't worryin'. An'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
now let's figger out what a regular prospector needs.
Bein' new at th' game I reckon I better get some advice.
What I'm dubious about are th' proper things to pry
th' nuggets loose with, an' hoist 'em on my cayuse," he
grinned. "Ought to have a pick, shovel, gold pan for
placer fussin'&mdash;'gold pan' sounds regular, don't it?&mdash;an'
some sacks to tie it up in. A dozen'll do for a
starter. I can allus come back for more."</p>

<p>"Or you can borrow a chuck waggin; that would be
handy because it would make it easy to get yore body
out, 'though I reckon they'll just bury you an' let it
go that way."</p>

<p>"They? Meanin' who?"</p>

<p>"I ain't got a word to say."</p>

<p>"There's some consolation in that," jeered Johnny.</p>

<p>"Yo're a fool!" snorted Pop heatedly.</p>

<p>"An' so that's went an' follered me down here, too,"
sighed Johnny. "A man can't get away from some
things. Well, let's get back on th' trail. All th' prospectors
I ever saw wore cowhide boots, with low, flat
heels. Somehow I can't see myself trampin' around
with these I'm wearin'; an' they're too expensive to
wear 'em out that way. What else? Need any blastin'
powder?"</p>

<p>"Cussed if I wouldn't grub-stake you if you wasn't
goin' up there," grinned Pop. "It takes a fool for
luck; an' it'll be just like you to fall down a canyon an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
butt th' dirt off'n a million dollar nugget. I got a
notion to do it anyhow."</p>

<p>"You needn't get no notions!" retorted Johnny.
"I'm goin' to hog it. Prospectors never get grub-staked
unless they're busted; an' I ain't got there yet.
Oh, yes; I got to get them fishhooks&mdash;you see, I ain't
aimin' to cripple my back workin' hard <i>all</i> th' time. I'll
fill a sack in th' mornin', eat my dinner an' rest all afternoon.
Next day I'll fill another sack, an' so on. Now,
what am I goin' to get for my outfit? I'll need a lot
of things."</p>

<p>"Go see Charley James, acrost th' street. He keeps
th' general store; an' he's got more trash than anybody
I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Mebby he can tell me what I need," suggested
Johnny, hopefully.</p>

<p>As Pop started to answer, the doorway darkened
and a man stepped into the room. Pop's face paled
and he swiftly moved to one side, out of range. The
newcomer glanced at Johnny, swore under his breath
and his hand streaked to his holster. It remained
there, for he discovered that he was glaring squarely
down a revolver barrel.</p>

<p>"Let loose of it!" snapped Johnny. "Now, then:
What's eatin' you?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, I mistook you for somebody else!"
muttered the other. "Comin' in from th' sunlight, sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>den
like, I couldn't see very well. My mistake, Stranger.
What'll you have?"</p>

<p>Johnny grunted skeptically. "Yo're shore you can
see all right now?"</p>

<p>"It's all right, Nelson," hastily interposed the anxious
proprietor, nodding emphatic assurance. "It's all
right!"</p>

<p>"My mistake, Mr. Nelson," smiled the stranger.
"I shouldn't 'a' been so hasty&mdash;but I was fooled. Yore
looks are shore misleadin'."</p>

<p>"They suits me. What's wrong about 'em?" demanded
Johnny.</p>

<p>"There you go again!" snorted Pop in quick disgust.
"A gent makes a mistake, says he didn't mean
no harm in it, an' you goes on th' prod! Didn't I <i>tell</i>
you that yore looks would get you into trouble?
Didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Is <i>that</i> it?" He arose and slipped the gun
back into its holster. "I'll take th' same, Stranger."</p>

<p>"Now yo're gettin' some sense," beamed Pop, smiling
with relief. "Mr. Nelson, shake han's with Tom
Quigley. Here's luck."</p>

<p>"Fill 'em again," grinned Johnny. "Not that I
hankers for th' kind of liquor you sells, but because we
has to do th' best we can with what's pervided."</p>

<p>"Pop's sellin' better liquor than he used to," smiled
Quigley. "Am I to thank you for th' improvement?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I refuse to accept th' responsibility," laughed
Johnny.</p>

<p>"Well, he had some waggin varnish last year, an'
for a long time we was puzzled to know what he did
with it. One day, somebody said his whiskey tasted
like a pine knot: an' then we knew th' answer."</p>

<p>"You both can go to th' devil," grinned Pop.</p>

<p>"Aimin' to make a long stay with us, Mr. Nelson?"
asked Quigley.</p>

<p>"That all depends on how soon I gets all th' gold
out of this country."</p>

<p>"Ah! Prospectin'?"</p>

<p>"Startin' tomorrow, I am: if this varnish don't kill
me.</p>

<p>"There ain't never been none found around here,
'though I never could understand why. There was a
couple of prospectors here some years ago, an' they
worked harder for nothin' than anybody I ever saw.
They covered th' ground purty well, but they was broke
about th' time they started south of town, an' had to
clear out. They claimed there was pay dirt down there,
but they couldn't get a grub-stake on th' strength of
that, so they just had to quit."</p>

<p>"That's where it is if it's any place," said Pop hurriedly.
"Th' river's workin' day an' night, pilin' it
ag'in them rock ledges above th' ford; an' it's been
doin' it since th' world began."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnny shook his head. "Mebby; but there ain't no
way to get it, unless you can drain th' river. I want
shallow water&mdash;little streams, where there's sand an'
gravel bars an' flats. I'm aimin' to work north of
here."</p>

<p>Quigley forced a smile and shook his head. "I'm
afraid you'll waste yore time. I've been all through
that section, in fact I live up there, an' some of my men
have fooled around lookin' for color. There ain't a
sign of it anywhere."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm aimin' to go back north when I get tired
of prospectin'," replied Johnny, grinning cheerfully;
"an' I figgers I can prospect around an' gradually
work up that way, toward Hope. I'll drop in an' see
you if I run acrost yore place. I reckon prospectin'
is a lonesome game."</p>

<p>"Didn't you ever try it before?" asked Quigley in
surprise.</p>

<p>"This is my first whirl at it," reluctantly admitted
Johnny. "I'm a cow-puncher, got tired of th' north
ranges an' drifted down here. An' I might 'a' stayed
a cow-puncher, only I got a job on th' CL an' worked
there for th' last two weeks; an' I got a-plenty. It
soured me of punchin'. Outside of bein' cussed suspicious,
that man Logan is loco. I don't mind bein' suspected
a little at first; but I ain't goin' to work like a
fool when there ain't no call for it. I might 'a' stuck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
it out, at that, only for a fool notion of his. That's
where I cut loose."</p>

<p>Quigley looked curious. "New notion?"</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Johnny contemptuously. "He got
th' idea that th' night air, close to th' river, ain't healthy
for th' cows! Told us to drive all of 'em back from th'
river every evenin' before we rode in. I said as how
we ought to blanket 'em, an' build fires under 'em. I
reckon mebby I was a mite sarcastic, at that. Well,
anyhow; we had an argument, an' I drew my pay an'
quit."</p>

<p>Pop let out a howl. "Good Lord!" he snorted.
"Evenin' air too wet for cows! Drive 'em back every
night! An' lemme tell you that outfit's just foolish
enough to do it, too. He-he-he!"</p>

<p>Quigley laughed, and then looked at the proprietor:
"Pop, we ain't forgettin'. We both has bought, an' it
usually goes th' rounds before it stops."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll set 'em up," growled Pop.</p>

<p>"You ranchin', Mr. Quigley?" asked Johnny.</p>

<p>"Well, I am, an' I ain't," answered Quigley. "I'm
farmin' an' ranchin' both, on a small scale. I got a few
head, but not enough to give me much bother. We sort
of let 'em look after themselves."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Johnny regretfully. "I thought mebby
if I got tired of prospectin', an' short of cash, that I
might get a job with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ain't got cows enough to keep me busy," explained
Quigley. "We let 'em wander, an' get 'em as we need
'em. Well," he said, turning as if to leave, "I'm sorry
about that fool break of mine, Mr. Nelson; an' to
prove it I'm goin' to give you some real good advice:
Keep away from th' Twin Buttes country. So long,
boys."</p>

<p>Johnny looked after him, and then faced Pop, shrugging
his shoulders. "I don't quite get th' drift of
that," he said slowly; "but he ought to know th' country
he lives in. I'll try Devil's Gap first; but I got a
cussed strong notion not to!"</p>

<p>Pop sighed with relief. "Let's go over an' see what
Charley's got for yore kit," he suggested.</p>

<p>Charley James was playing solitaire on a box laid
across a nail keg and he smiled a welcome as they entered.</p>

<p>"Charley," said Pop. "This cow-puncher's aimin'
to change his spots. He's a amatchure prospector an'
wants us to pick out his outfit."</p>

<p>"I can believe that he's an amatchure if he's goin'
to try it in this part of th' country," smiled Charley.
"Nobody's ever tried it down here before."</p>

<p>Johnny was about to mention the two prospectors
referred to by Mr. Quigley, but thought better of it.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's been tried," said Pop casually. "But they
didn't stay long. What you got in that line, Charley?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ain't shore; but first you want an axe. Come on;
we'll saunter aroun' an' pick things out as they hit our
eye. Here's th' axe&mdash;double bitted, six-pounder."</p>

<p>"Too big," chuckled Pop. "There ain't none of
them there redwood trees out here; they're in Californy."</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted Charley. "Mebbyso; but that's a
good axe."</p>

<p>"Pop's right; it's too heavy," decided Johnny. "An'
I don't want it double bitted because I may want to
drive stakes with it."</p>

<p>"All right," said Charley, who had hoped to at last
get rid of the big axe. "Here's a three-pounder&mdash;'Little
Gem'&mdash;an' it shore is. All right; now for th'
next article."</p>

<p>In half an hour the outfit was assembled and they
were turning to leave the store when Johnny suddenly
grabbed his companions. "What about some fishhooks?"
he demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>Charley rubbed his head reflectively. "I think
mebby I got some; don't remember throwin' 'em away.
There was some with feathers, an' some without; plain
hooks, an' flies. Brought 'em with me when I first
came out here, an' never used 'em. Ought to have
some line, too; an' a reel somewheres. I'll hunt 'em
up an' put 'em with yore duffle. You can cut yoreself
a pole. They'll be a little present from me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," beamed Johnny, and forthwith Pop
dragged them to his place of business.</p>

<p>Johnny left the following morning, and one week
later he returned, trudging along beside his loaded
horse, and he was the owner of a generous amount
of gold, the treasure of a "pocket" upon which he had
blundered. He determined to keep this a secret, for
if he let it be known that he had found "color," what
excuse could he offer for leaving that field? It fit
too well into his plans to be revealed.</p>

<p>Pop grinned a welcome: "Have any luck?"</p>

<p>"Fishin', yes," laughed Johnny. "Bet I moved ten
acres of gravel. I wasted a week; now I'm goin' north."</p>

<p>Pop frowned. "I reckon you'll have yore own way;
but put in yore time fishin' an' prospectin', an' mind
yore own business."</p>

<p>"Shore," said Johnny. "Look here," unrolling a
bundle and producing two of the gold sacks, which
were heavy and bulging. Pop stared, speechless, until
his new friend opened one of them and dumped four
dressed trout on the bar.</p>

<p>"Slip 'em in a fryin' pan with some bacon," grinned
Johnny.</p>

<p>"Get 'em in th' river?" demanded Pop incredulously.</p>

<p>"You know that draw runnin' east from th' Gap&mdash;th'
one with them two dead pines leanin' against each
other?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; 'tain't more'n a mile from th' ford!"</p>

<p>"I found 'em up there, hidin' in a bush."</p>

<p>"Reckon you think that's funny," grunted Pop.
"Why them's <i>brook</i> trout! I ain't had any since I
was a boy. Th' devil with business! I'm goin' fishin'
one day a week. Now where you goin'?"</p>

<p>"Got some for Charley," laughed Johnny from the
door.</p>

<p>Charley looked up from his eternal solitaire:
"Hello, Nelson!"</p>

<p>"Look what I got," exulted Johnny, extending the
bag.</p>

<p>"God help us!" exclaimed Charley. "Did you&mdash;did
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did. Brook trout, Pop says. Prospectin' ain't
nothin' compared to fishin'. Pop's goin' one day a
week, an' after you eat these mebby you'll be with
him."</p>

<p>"Pop can't put on no airs with me," chuckled Charley.
"If he can afford to close up, so can I. But
you shouldn't 'a' poked no bulgin' gold sack at me
like that! It was a shock. Come on; let's take somethin'
for it." He grabbed the fish and led the way
across the street; and for the rest of the afternoon
three happy men discussed prospecting and trout fishing,
but the latter was by far the more important.</p>

PREPARATIONS</h2></div>


<p>The next morning Johnny said good-bye to Pop
and walked by Pepper's side, watching the big
pack on her back, while Pop, shaking his head, entered
his place of business and forthwith began work
on a crude sign which, one day a week, would hang
on his locked front door.</p>

<p>Well to the north of Hastings, Johnny came to a
brook flowing through a deep ravine, and, forsaking
the trail, followed the little stream westward and
evening found him encamped in a small clearing. He
spent several days here, panning the stream and fishing
during daylight, and scouting in his moccasins at
night. He paid a visit to Little Canyon and explored
the valley he was in, and at the head of the valley
he found a deep-walled pasture above a short, narrow
canyon. Deciding to erect a cabin at the canyon
entrance as a monument to the innocence of his activities,
he prospected a sand bar near by and rediscovered
the gold which he had found at Devil's Gap,
which served as an excellent excuse for locating there
permanently; and after a week of hard work, the cabin
became a reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>His every movement had been made upon the supposition
that he was being watched; and the supposition
became a fact when he discovered boot-prints
along the opposite bank of the creek. These promised
him a trail by which he could easily locate the
rustlers' ranch, and at daylight the next morning he
was following them and finally reached a great ridge,
which he ascended with caution.</p>

<p>Below him was a deep valley, through which a
stream moved sluggishly, and at the upper end was a
narrow canyon, not more than ten paces wide, through
which the stream escaped from another valley above.
Twin Buttes were several miles to the east of him,
lying a mile or more north of the valley. He looked
through the deep canyon and at the corner of a stone
house at its other end, and as he watched he saw several
men come into view. One of them motioned
toward the south and paused to speak to his companions,
whereupon Johnny wriggled down the slope and
set out for his camp.</p>

<p>Back again in his own valley, he built a sapling
fence across the little canyon, cut a pile of firewood
near by, and then rode to Hastings, where he nearly
gave Charley heart failure by displaying a pleasing
amount of virgin gold. He did not see Pop because on
the saloon door he found a sign reading: "Back at 4
<span class="smcap">P. M.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very cheerful cow-puncher who rode to the
new cabin that evening, for he was matching his wits
against those of his natural enemies, he was playing a
lone hand in his own way against odds, and the game
was only beginning.</p>

<p>In perfect condition, virile, young, enduring, he had
serene confidence in his ability to take care of himself.
He admitted but one master in the art of gun-play,
and that man had been his teacher and best
friend for years. Even now Hopalong could beat him
on the draw, but barely, and he could roll his two
guns forward, backward and "mixed;" but he could
shoot neither faster nor straighter than his pupil.</p>

<p>Johnny could not roll a gun because he never had
tried very hard to master that most difficult of all gun-play,
regarding it as an idle accomplishment, good only
for exhibition purposes, and, while awe inspiring,
Johnny had no yearning for it. He clove to strict utility
and did not care to call attention to his wooden-handled,
flare-butt Frontiers. There was no ornamentation
on them, no ivory, inlay, or engraving.
The only marks on their heavy, worn frames were a
few dents. He had such a strong dislike for fancy
guns that the sight of ivory grips made his lips curl,
and such things as pearl handles filled him with grieving
contempt for the owner.</p>

<p>He never mentioned his guns to any but his closest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
friends, and they were as unconscious a part of him
as his arms or his legs. And it was his creed that no
man but himself should touch them, his friends excepted.
He wore them low because utility demanded
it; and to so wear them, and to tie them down besides,
was in itself a responsibility, for there were men who
would not be satisfied with the quiet warning.</p>

<p>In other things, from routine ranch work to man-hunting,
from roping and riding to rifle shooting, the
old outfit of the Bar-20 had been his teachers and they
had taken him in hand at an early age. His rifle he
had copied from Hopalong; but Red had taught him
the use of it, and to his way of thinking Red Connors
was without a peer in the use of the longer weapon.</p>

<p>Johnny was a genius with his six-guns, one of those
few men produced in a generation; and he did not
belong to the class of fancy gun-workers who shine
at exhibitions and fall short when lead is flying and
the nerves are sorely tried. He shot from his hips by
instinct, and that is the real test of utility. Had he
turned his talents to ends which lay outside the law
he would have become the most dangerous and the
most feared man in the cow-country.</p>

<p>John Logan awoke with a start, sat up suddenly
in his bunk and grunted a profane query as his hand
closed over his Colt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's Nelson," softy said a voice from outside the
window. "Don't make so much noise," it continued,
as its owner dropped a handful of pebbles on the
ground. "I wanted you awake before I showed myself.
Never like to walk into a man's room in th'
dark, when he's asleep an' not expectin' visitors. 'Specially
when he's worryin' about rustlers. It ain't allus
healthy."</p>

<p>"All right," growled the foreman, "but you don't
have to throw 'em; you can toss 'em, easy, from there.
I've got a welt on my head as big as a chew of tobacco.
I'm shore glad you couldn't find nothin' out
there that was any bigger. You comin' in or am I
comin' out?"</p>

<p>The door squeaked open and squeaked shut and
then a chair squeaked.</p>

<p>"You got a musical room," observed Johnny, chuckling
softly. "Yore bunk squeaked, too, when you sat
up."</p>

<p>"It was a narrow squeak for you," grunted Logan,
reluctantly putting down the Colt. "If I'd seen a head
I'd 'a' let drive on suspicion. I was havin' a cussed bad
dream an' was all het up. My cows was goin' up Little
Canyon in whole herds an' I couldn't seem to stop 'em
nohow."</p>

<p>"Keepin' my head out of trouble is my long suit,"
chuckled Johnny. "An' there ain't none of yore cows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
goin' up Little Canyon&mdash;not till I steal some of 'em.
Been wonderin' where I was an' what I was doin'?"</p>

<p>"Not very much," answered the foreman. "Got a
match? We been gettin' our mail reg'lar every week,
an' th' boys allus drop in for a drink at Pop's; an'
they're good listeners. Say! What th' h&mdash;l is this
I hears about puttin' blankets on my cows an' shovin'
'em into th' river every night? Well, that can wait.
You've shore made an impression on Ol' Pop Hayes.
Th' old Piute can't talk about nothin' but you. Every
time th' boys drop in there they get fed up on you.
Of course they don't show much interest in yore doin's;
an' they don't have to. They says yo're a d&mdash;d quitter,
an' stuff like that, an' Pop gets riled up an' near
scalps 'em. What you been doin' to get him so friendly?
I never thought he'd be friendly, like that, to anythin'
but a silver dollar."</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;just treat him decent," replied
Johnny.</p>

<p>"Huh! I been treatin' him decent for ten years, an'
he still thinks I'm some kind of an unknown animal.
If he saw me dyin' in th' street he wouldn't drag me
five feet, unless I was blockin' his door; but he's doin'
a lot of worryin' about you, all right. What you been
doin' besides courtin' Pop an' Andy Jackson, washin'
gravel an' ketchin' fish?"</p>

<p>Johnny laughed. "I've been playin' cautious&mdash;an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
right now I ain't shore that I've fooled 'em a whole
lot. Here, lemme tell you th' whole thing&mdash;" and
he explained his activities since leaving the CL.</p>

<p>At its conclusion Logan grunted. "You got nerve
an' patience; an' mebby you got brains. If you can
keep 'em from bein' shot out of yore head, you have.
An' you say they ain't usin' Little Canyon? I know
they ain't usin' it now; but was they?"</p>

<p>"Not since th' frost come out of th' ground," replied
Johnny. "I can't tell you about what they <i>are</i>
doin' because I'm just beginnin' to get close to 'em.
Th' next time you see me I may know somethin'.
Now you listen to me," and he gave the foreman certain
instructions, which Logan repeated over after
him. "Now, then: I want about sixty feet of rope
strong enough to hold me, an' I want a short, straight
iron."</p>

<p>"Come with me," ordered the foreman, slipping
on his clothes; and in ten minutes they emerged from
the blacksmith shop, which also was a storeroom, and
Johnny carried a coil of old but strong rope and an iron
bar.</p>

<p>"I never thought I'd be totin' a runnin' iron," he
chuckled. "If my friends could only see me now!
Johnny Nelson, cow-thief an' brand-blotter!"</p>

<p>"You needn't swell up," growled Logan. "You
ain't th' only one in this country right now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Johnny, "go back an' finish yore dream&mdash;mebby
you can find out how to make them cows
come back through Little Canyon."</p>

<p>"Yo're goin' to do that," responded Logan; "an'
<i>I'm</i> goin' to close that window in case <i>you</i> come back.
I ain't forgot nothin' you said&mdash;an' if we don't see
one of yore signs for a period of five days, we'll comb
yore valley an' th' whole Twin Buttes country. So
long!"</p>

<p>Johnny melted into the dark, a low whistle sounded
and in a few minutes Logan heard the rhythmic drumming
of hoofs, rapidly growing fainter.</p>

<h2 id="VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
A MOONLIGHT RECONNAISSANCE</h2></div>


<p>The evening following his visit to the CL, Johnny
went to bed early but not to sleep. For several
hours he lay thinking and listening, and then he arose
and put on his moccasins, threw on his shoulder Logan's
rope, now knotted every foot of its length,
slipped out of the cabin and was swallowed up in the
darkness along the base of the rocky wall. To cover
the few yards between the cabin and the narrow crevice
took ten minutes, and to go softly up the crevice
took twice as long.</p>

<p>Reaching the top he listened intently, and then
moved slowly and silently to a small clump of pines
growing close to the rim of the steep wall enclosing
the walled-in pasture, at a point where it was so sheer
and smooth that he believed it would not be watched.
Fastening one end of the rope to a tree, he lowered
the rest of it over the wall and went down. Pausing
again to listen, he made his way to a line of stones
which lay across the creek, crossed with dry feet, and
reached the northern wall of the pasture. This could
be climbed at half a dozen places and he soon was
up it and on his way north. After colliding with sev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>eral
bowlders and tripping twice he waited until the
moon arose and then went on again at a creditable
speed.</p>

<p>The crescent moon had risen well above the tops
of Twin Buttes when a man in moccasins moved cautiously
across a high plateau some miles north of Nelson's
creek and finally dropped to all fours and proceeded
much more slowly. From all fours to stomach
was his next choice and he wriggled toward the edge
of the plateau, pausing every foot or so to remove
loose stones. These he put aside before going on
again, for there is no telling where a rolling pebble
will stop, or the noise it may make, when the edge
of a mesa wall is but a few feet away. Coming to
within an arm's length of the edge, he first made sure
that the rim was solid rock and free from dirt and
pebbles; and then, hitching forward slowly, he peered
down into the deep valley.</p>

<p>Its immensity amazed him, for upon the occasion
of his former reconnaissance he had viewed it from
the outside; and as a picture of his own pasture flashed
into his mind he snorted softly at the contrast, for
where he had acres, this great "sink" had square
miles. It was wider than his own was long, and it
stretched away in the faint moonlight until its upper
reaches were lost to his eyes. It was large enough
to hold one great butte in its middle, and perhaps there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
were more; and from where he lay he judged the wall
below him dropped straight down for three hundred
feet.</p>

<p>"There ain't no line ridin' here, unless th' cows grow
wings," he muttered.</p>

<p>To the south of him were four lighted windows near
the forbidding blackness of the entrance canyon, and
from their spacing he deduced two houses. And across
from the windows he could make out a vague quadrangle,
which experience told him was the horse corral.
As if to confirm his judgment there came from
it at that moment a shrill squeal and the sound of
hoofs on wood, muffled by the distance. And from
the corral extended a faint line which ran across the
valley and became lost in the darkness near the opposite
cliff. This he knew to be a fence.</p>

<p>"If this valley ends like it begins, three or four
men can handle an awful lot of cows, 'cept at drive
time," he soliloquized, and then listened intently to
the sound of distant voices.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i1"><i>... many happy hours away,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>A sittin' an a singin' by a little cottage do-o-r.</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Where lived my darlin' Nel-lie Gr-a-ay,</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>came floating faintly from far below him.</p>

<p>He peered in the direction of the singing and barely
made out a moving blot well out in the valley. As it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
came steadily nearer, the blot resolved itself into several
dots, and the chorus had greater volume. It
appeared that the group was harmonizing.</p>

<p>"You'll be doin' somethin' more than sittin' an'
singin' at yore little cottage door one of these days,"
grunted Johnny savagely. It was his rebuff to the
thought which came to him of how long it had been
since he had ruined the silence in company with his
friends. "That first feller is purty good; but one of
'em shore warbles like a sick calf."</p>

<p>Several other dots arose suddenly from the earth
and lumbered sleepily away as the horsemen approached
them.</p>

<p>"There's some of Logan's cows, I reckon," grunted
the watcher grimly. "Wish I could see better. I've
got to do my prospectin' in daylight; an' I got to find
some way to ride over here&mdash;waste too much time
on foot."</p>

<p>More squealing came from the corral and grew in
volume as other horses joined in it. From the noise
it appeared to be turning into a free-for-all. A door
in one of the distant houses suddenly opened and
framed a rectangular patch of light, dull and yellow;
and from it emerged a bright little light which swung
in short, jerky arcs close to the ground and went rapidly
toward the corral. Soon thereafter the squealing
ceased and a moment later the little light went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
bobbing back again, blotted out in rhythmic dashes
by the swinging legs beside it.</p>

<p>"Big Jerry fightin' again," laughed one of the horsemen
during a pause in the singing. Johnny barely was
able to hear him.</p>

<p>rumbled the harmonizers, bursting into a thundering
perpetration on the repetition of the last two words.</p>

<p>"Th' farther off they get th' better they sound,"
growled Johnny as the harmonizers were swallowed
up in the darkness near the opposite cliff. "They'd
sound better at about ten miles."</p>

<p>Lying comfortably on his stomach, his head out over
the rim of the wall, he was lost in thought when a
sudden, startled snort behind him nearly caused him
to go over the edge. A contortionist hardly could
have changed ends quicker than he did; he simply
went up in the air and when he came down again he
was on hands and knees, one foot where his head
had been. But he did not stop there; indeed, he did
not even pause there, for he kept on moving until he
was on his feet, his knees bent and his head thrust forward,
and each hand, without conscious direction, held
a gun. And almost instantly they chocked back into
the holsters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>A gray shape was backing slowly into the shadows
of a bowlder, two green eyes boring through the
gloom, and Johnny's hair became ambitious.</p>

<p>"I dassn't shoot, I dassn't run, an' I can't back up!
All right; when in doubt try a bluff; but I shore hopes
it's th' bluffin' kind!"</p>

<p>He emitted a throaty, ferocious snarl, dropped the
tips of his fingers to the earth and started for the
bowlder and the green eyes, on a series of back-humping,
awkward jumps, like a weak-kneed calf cavorting
playfully. Another snort, curious, incredulous, frightened,
came from the bowlder and a great gray wolf
backed off hastily, but with a hesitating uncertainty
which was not as reassuring as might be hoped for.</p>

<p>Johnny let out another snarl, more terrifying than
the first, humped his back energetically, waved his legs,
and then with a low-toned but blood-curdling shriek,
leaped at the wavering cow-killer. The gray silhouette
lengthened and vanished, simply melting into the darkness
as though it had urgent business elsewhere.</p>

<p>Johnny arose, a rock in his hand, and sighed with
relief; and his ambitious hair settled back again into
its accustomed place while the prickling along his spine
died out.</p>

<p>"Holy smoke! What if it had been half-starved,
or a grizzly! Blast you!" he growled, shaking a
vengeful fist at the presumed locality of the wolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"You just come snortin' around <i>my</i> valley! I'll shoot
yore insides all over th' landscape!"</p>

<p>Hanging onto the rock, he readjusted his belts and
went nearer the entrance canyon to get a closer view
of the houses and surroundings. When again he
looked over the edge of the precipice he was directly
over the corral and across from the houses, which the
rays of the moon, slanting through a break in the opposite
cliff, now faintly revealed.</p>

<p>There were three houses and they were low, long
and narrow, and built of stone, with the customary
adobe roofs; and they were built in echelon, the three
end walls appearing as one from the canyon. He
nodded appreciatively, for it required no great imagination
to see, in his mind's eye, the loopholes which
undoubtedly ornamented that end of the houses. The
narrow canyon, straight as an arrow and fully half a
mile long, lay at almost perfect right angles to the
three walls. A handful of determined men, cool and
accurate, in those houses could hold the canyon against
great odds while their food, water and ammunition
held out. Moving his head, he caught a sudden glint,
and peered intently to discover what had caused it.
He moved again until he saw it the second time, and
then he knew. A small trickle of water flowed from
a spring back near the great wall, and it passed under
one corner of each house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's purty good!" he ejaculated in ungrudging
admiration. He was something of a strategist himself
and he was not slow to pay respect to the handiwork
of genius when he saw it. "Built 'em like steps
so as to cover th' canyon from all three houses; an'
diverted that little stream so they could get water without
showing themselves. No matter which side of
them houses is rushed, there is allus three walls to
face. Th' only weak spots are th' north an' south
corners. If they ain't loopholed a good man could
sneak right up to th' corner of th' end houses; but
what he'd do after he got there, I don't know."</p>

<p>He studied the problem in silence and then nodded
his head: "Huh! Them walls don't overhang, an'
so they can't shoot down close to 'em. Mebby I've
found th' weak spot&mdash;but I'll have to get a whole lot
closer than I am now before I'm shore of it. An' that
can wait."</p>

<p>He wriggled back from the wall and arose. "Seen
all I can at night. Don't even know if these fellers <i>are</i>
rustlin'. Bein' suspicious an' bein' shore ain't th'
same. But th' next time I come up here I won't leave
until I am shore, not if it takes all summer. Logan
said to be shore to find out how many there are, their
trail from his ranch an' th' place where they operates
on th' CL. Says he's got to get 'em actually stealin'
his cows on his ranch. Says he ain't got no friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
out here and that th' other ranches acts like they was
sort of on th' side of th' thieves. That's a h&mdash;l of a
note, that is! Buck, an' Hoppy, an' us: we never gave
a whoop where we found rustlers if they had our cows;
an' we never gave two whoops in h&mdash;l what th' rest
of th' country thought about it. Times have changed.
Imagine us askin' anybody if we could shoot rustlers!
Huh!"</p>

<p>He started back the way he had come up, and reached
his own valley without incident; but when he wriggled
toward the wall he was puzzled, and worried. There
was the clump of pines up above him, ghostly in the
faint moonlight; but he could see no rope. Thankful
that he had been cautious in crossing the valley, he
wriggled a little closer and then started back over his
trail, recrossed the valley, climbed the other wall in
the shelter offered by a crevice and slipped along the
great ridge. All he cared about now was to get back
into the cabin without being seen. All kinds of conjectures
ran through his head concerning the absence
of the rope, and while he thrashed them out he kept
going ahead, careful to take full advantage of the
wealth of cover at hand.</p>

<p>His senses were keyed to their highest pitch of efficiency
and at times he concentrated on one of them
at the expense of the others. While he used his eyes
constantly, it was in his ears that he placed the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
confidence. The man who does the moving about is at
a disadvantage, which he keenly realized.</p>

<p>He did not mind so much being away from the
cabin if he could make it appear to be innocent; and
to that end he moved steadily toward the Hastings
trail. His horse was not to be seen, and that worried
him. It could have strayed, for he had neither
picketed nor hobbled it, but he feared that it had not
strayed.</p>

<p>Passing his old camp site he heard a noise, and flattened
himself on the ground. It came again and from
the edge of the clearing where he had spent his first
few nights in the valley. Anyone foolish enough to
make a noise, under the circumstances, was foolish
enough to be stalked by any man who had good sense;
and he proceeded to do the stalking.</p>

<p>It took him quite a while to get around back of the
place where his tent had stood, but when he finally
got there he was repaid for his time and trouble. It
was not the direction from which he would be expected,
if the rustlers' suspicions were aroused; and there was
a certain twisting path through the brush which was
devoid of twigs and sticks.</p>

<p>Foot by foot he crept forward until he could see
the big bowlder in the clearing, and then he paused
as the sound was heard again, and he tried to classify
it. A twig snapped, and then another sound made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
him nod quickly. It was a horse; that was certain;
but could it be Pepper? While he pondered and listened
to the slow, interrupted steps, a dark shape
moved out from the deep shadows of the trees, pricked
its ears, stretched out its head toward him, nickered
softly and slowly advanced.</p>

<p>He stared in amazement, for while it was Pepper,
the saddle was on her back; and when he had left
the cabin the saddle was inside. But, was it, though?
In a moment his mind had marshaled in review before
him all his acts of the previous day; all but one.
Had he unsaddled the horse when he had ridden
back from the upper end of his little valley? Of
course he had; why should he have neglected to do
such a thing as that? But, perhaps he hadn't. He
swore under his breath and backed away, for the horse
was coming nearer all the time. It was his saddle;
he could tell that easily. And then all of his doubts
cleared in a flash. When he had ridden in from the
pasture he had started to remove the saddle, but
when he thought of his boiling pots he had pushed the
end of the cinch strap back under the little holding
strap, and he had not shoved it home. Right now
that cinch end should be sticking out in a loop. Craning
his neck and shifting silently he managed to see
it; and a chuckle escaped from him. He whistled
softly, so softly that anyone a hundred feet away could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
not have heard it; but the horse heard it and nickered
again. What fools these men were! Did her master
think that she had to hear a whistle to know that
he was about, when the wind was right and he was
so close?</p>

<p>Pepper was a well-trained, intelligent animal, and
Johnny knew it better than anyone else; and Pepper
had a strong aversion to strangers, which he also
knew; and knowing that, he was instantly assured that
there were no strangers in the immediate vicinity because
Pepper was thoroughly at her ease. The black
head thrust forward into his face and the bared teeth
snapped at him, whereupon he playfully cuffed the
velvety nozzle. Pepper forthwith swung her head
suddenly and knocked off her master's hat, and pretended
to be in a fine rage.</p>

<p>"You old coyote!" chuckled Johnny, cuffing her
again. "Cussed if you ain't th' most no-account old
fool I ever saw. But I ought to be kicked from here
to Hastings an' back again for leavin' that saddle on
you all afternoon an' night. Will some sugar square
it? Hey! Get out of my pocket&mdash;it's in th' shack,"
he laughed. And there was a note in his laughter that
a horse of Pepper's intelligence might easily understand.</p>

<p>Mounting, he rode across the clearing, and when
he reached the water course he followed it to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
cabin. Pepper had given him the card he needed now
for, in the saddle and careless of being seen, which
was his best play, dangerous as it might be, he was
riding home from an evening spent in Hastings. As
to answering any questions about the dangling rope,
he either would inform the curious that it was none
of their business, or lie; and whether the lie would be
a humorous exaggeration which could not possibly be
believed, or adroit, plausible, and convincing would
be a matter of mood.</p>

<p>Whistling softly he rode across the little plateau,
stripped the saddle from Pepper, who waited until he
returned with some sugar, and lit the lantern. Pepper
was not the only member of that partnership
whose nose was useful; and the faint odor of a vile,
frontier cigar had lingered after its possessor had
departed.</p>

<p>"Huh! We must 'a' swapped ends tonight; but
I'll bet he's doin' more wonderin' than me. He thinks
he's got a lead, findin' that rope. I know he didn't
see me put it there, or go down it; an' I'll bet he don't
know that I came back to it. He can watch an' be
cussed."</p>

<h2 id="VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
A COUNCIL OF WAR</h2></div>


<p>Clearing away the breakfast pans the following
morning, Johnny did some soliloquizing.</p>

<p>"This is a nice little shack, but I ain't stuck on it
a whole lot. Now that I've built it, I've got to use
it or tip off my hand; an' as long as I use it they know
where to find me. I've got to come back to it. At th'
worst I can hold it against them for five days; an'
then th' outfit'll be up here an' drive 'em off. But if
it comes to trouble they won't let me get to it; they'll
pick me off when I'm outside. They're gettin' more
suspicious all th' time, too, judgin' from that missin'
rope an' th' smell of that cigar. Nope; I don't like
this shack a little bit. An' some night when I'm
sneakin' back to it, suppose one of 'em is in it, waitin'
for me? That wouldn't be nice. First chance I get
I'll tote my tarpaulin an' some supplies out of here
an' cache 'em some place not too far away."</p>

<p>Going into the little valley he was greatly surprised
to see the rope hanging as he had left it, but he did
not give it a second glance, and acted as though he
was ignorant that it had been removed. He busied
himself carrying firewood from the pile and heaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
it up in the center of a cleared space, ready to be lit
later on, and then removed the two saplings which
made the gate to his rough fence and swung them aside
so that they formed a V-shaped approach to the opening.
Having performed these mysterious rites he
passed the cabin, climbed up the crevice, recovered the
rope, and returned. Carrying it into the house he
carelessly closed the door behind him, went swiftly to
the loose log in the rear wall and removed the things
he had hidden behind it, rolling them up in the tarpaulin.
Then he picked ravelings from an empty salt
sack, tied them together and rolled them in the dirt
on the floor until they matched it in color. After filling
the water pails and chopping some firewood he
took the gold pan and his rod and sought the creek,
where he spent the rest of the day working and
fishing.</p>

<p>Darkness found his supper dishes washed and put
away, and, kneeling by the door, he stretched a string
of weak ravelings across the opening, six inches above
the sill. Cord not only would have been too prominent,
but too strong; a foot would break the ravelings and
never feel the contact. Whistling to Pepper, he took
his saddle and the tarpaulin, stepped high over the
door sill and in a few minutes was riding down the
valley. Just before he came to the Hastings trail he
threw the tarpaulin far into the brush without slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>ing
the horse, and then, crossing the trail, plunged
into the sloping draw which eventually became Little
Canyon.</p>

<p>Pepper gingerly picked her way down the rough
canyon trail without any directions from her rider,
crossed the level, bowlder-strewn flat to the river, and
stopped at the water's edge.</p>

<p>The Deepwater gurgled and swished, cold, swift,
deep, and black, and Johnny shivered in anticipation
of the discomforts due to be his for the next few
hours. Unbuckling his belts, he slung them around
his neck, and in his hat he placed the contents of his
pockets. Giving Pepper a friendly and encouraging
slap, he urged her into the river, a task which she did
not like; but she overcame her prejudices against ice
water and plunged in, swimming with powerful strokes.
Emerging on the other bank they cantered briskly
to the faintly beaten trail where Billy Atwood spent
so many hours, and along it until a small, isolated
clump of trees loomed up. There was a stump among
them and on this Johnny placed a stone. Then he
waited, shivering, until the moon came up.</p>

<p>A black blot arose hastily from the earth and became
a cow. Two more near it also arose, and the
three lumbered off clumsily, driven in the right direction
by a horse that knew her work. It was her
firm belief that cows had been put on earth to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
bossed by her, and no matter how quickly they swerved
she was always at the right place at the right time
and kept them going as her master wished. She neither
hurried them too fast nor pressed them too
closely, for she knew that when a range cow is pushed
too hard it is likely to go "on the prod" and change
instantly from an easy-going, docile victim to a stubborn,
vicious quadruped with no sense whatever and
a strong yearning to use its horns.</p>

<p>It did not take long to get six cows to the edge of
the Deepwater; but it took two hours of careful but
hard riding, perseverance and profuse profanity to get
them into the water. It was no one-man job, and
with a horse that had less training than Pepper it
might have proved to be an impossibility; but at last
one cow preferred the water to being made a fool of,
and when it went in the others reluctantly followed.
Scrambling out on the farther bank they doubtless were
congratulating themselves upon having escaped a pest,
when the pest itself emerged behind them and drove
them slowly but steadily toward Little Canyon. In
it they went, and up it; and as they paused on the
main trail to determine which way to go, the pest arrived
and decided the question for them, drove them
across it and into a small valley; and as day broke,
six unhurried, placid cows wandered slowly into the
crooked canyon and through the opening in the fence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Having changed the brands from the original CL
to an equally sprawling GB, he returned to the cabin,
unsaddled, and entered, stepping high over the sill.
No one was there and nothing had been disturbed,
but when he looked for the thread he found it snapped
and lying on the floor.</p>

<p>Starting a brisk fire he hung his wet clothes before
it on crude tripods made of sticks, hastily ate a substantial
breakfast, fastened the shutter of the window,
hung the gold pan over the closed door to serve as an
alarm if anyone should enter, and in a few minutes
was asleep.</p>

<p>Across the creek, high up on the great ridge, a
man lay behind a bowlder, a rifle in his hands, and he
kept close watch on the cabin. Waiting a reasonable
length of time, he finally arose, waved his hand and
settled down again, the rifle covering the cabin door.
In the pasture another man emerged from a thicket
and hurried toward the canyon, swearing softly when
he saw the changed brands. It took no second sight
to tell him what the original brand had been. Emerging
from the canyon he paused, glanced up at his
friend, who made a significant sign, debated something
in his mind, and then, pulling out a notebook,
scrawled something in it and tore out the page.
Creeping softly he reached the cabin door, stuck the
page on it and then hurried away to join his friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
They climbed the ridge and hastened northward, conversing
with animation.</p>

<p>When they reached the canyon leading to their
ranch a tall, rangy man advanced to meet them.
"Well," he said, smiling: "what did you find out
about the rope? An' what kept you so long?"</p>

<p>"We found out a-plenty," growled Ackerman angrily.
"That feller ain't no prospector. I've said
so all along. He don't know enough about prospectin'
to earn a livin' on th' top of a pile of gold!"</p>

<p>His companion nodded quickly. "Jim's right; he's
a rustler. Doin' it single-handed, on a small scale."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> ain't nowise shore that rustlin' is his game, neither,"
said Ackerman. "If he is he's a new hand at
it. I could rebrand them cows in just about half th'
time it took him, an' do a better job. He's dangerous;
an' he should 'a' been shot long before this. I can
get him today," he urged.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt that; but I wouldn't do it," smiled
Quigley. "An' I hope <i>yo're</i> shore he ain't Logan."</p>

<p>Jim swore. "Yes; but if he keeps on rustlin' he'll
have Logan after him. An' that'll mean that we'll
have to look sharp, an' mebby fight. You let me get
him, Tom."</p>

<p>Quigley shook his head. "'Tain't necessary. All
we got to do is let him know he ain't wanted. Steal
his cows, burn his cabin; an' shoot near him a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of times, until he realizes how easy we can shoot
<i>through</i> him. But I ain't shore I want him drove
away."</p>

<p>"Huh!" ejaculated Ackerman.</p>

<p>"Huh!" repeated Fleming foolishly.</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Quigley, "for one thing Logan's
purty shore to begin missin' cows before long. What
puzzles me is that he ain't missed 'em long ago. Then
he'll begin watchin' his range nights."</p>

<p>"But he won't watch up there," interrupted Fleming.
"He don't know about that ford."</p>

<p>"There's only two breaks in th' Barrier," continued
Quigley, ignoring the interruption, "that are near
Nelson's valley; an' they're th' first places Logan'll
watch. They're Big an' Little Canyons. Some fine
night Nelson will get caught or followed. Bein' a
stranger, an' once workin' for th' CL, Logan will think
he's got th' rustlers. He'll find signs that'll make him
look in Nelson's pasture&mdash;if they ain't there naturally
we'll put 'em there. They'll find his cabin an'
his rebranded herd. When they go back again they'll
reckon that th' rustlin' is all over; an' we'll still be in
th' game, lettin' up a little for a while, an' be better
off than ever. Savvy my drift?"</p>

<p>Ackerman shook his head savagely. "With them
six cows, an' Logan missin' hundreds?" he sarcastically
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Quigley smiled patronizingly. "Findin' only a few
won't mean nothin', except that he's driven off th' rest
every time he has got a few together, an' sold 'em.
Now if you was to take that notebook that's stickin'
out of yore pocket, an' write in it some words an'
figgers showin' that he's sold so many cows, an' what
he got for 'em each time, it might help. We'll know
when Logan's due, an' we can drop that book where
he'll find it. You never want to kill anythin' till yo're
shore it ain't goin' to be useful. There's one thing
I'm set on: there ain't going to be no unnecessary
killin'."</p>

<p>Ackerman laughed grimly. "Well, anyhow; I've
started things. I left a note on his door tellin' him
what to do."</p>

<p>"What did you write?" demanded Quigley.</p>

<p>Ackerman told him defiantly. "An' what's more,"
he added, "I'm goin' to do some pot-shootin' before
long."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Quigley, "I'd rather drive him
out, an' then watch him for a while. I ain't shore he
can't be scared. Do you think he suspects he's bein'
watched?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," answered Fleming.</p>

<p>"I know he does!" snapped Ackerman. "Why
does he paw around that gravel bed an' pertend that
he's found gold in it? There ain't no gold there!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Quigley laughed. "He found gold, all right. Charley
James saw it: an' he got it right there. He wanted
Charley to take it in pay. I don't doubt that you
know somethin' about prospectin' but 'gold is where
it's found.'"</p>

<p>Ackerman thrust his head forward. "Gold in that
gravel! H&mdash;l!"</p>

<p>"Charley saw it," grunted Quigley.</p>

<p>"Charley be d&mdash;d!" snorted Ackerman. He
looked closely at Quigley and suddenly demanded:
"What makes you so set ag'in us shootin' him?"</p>

<p>Quigley regarded him evenly. "There was a lot
of talk when Porter was found dead. I told you all
at th' time. Four men have got curious, come up in
these hills an' never went out again. Twin Buttes has
a bad name; an' th' next dead man that's blamed on
us is goin' to make a lot more talk an' may stir up
trouble.</p>

<p>"Now then: Pop knows that Nelson's up here, an'
that means that everybody knows it. He saw me reach
for my gun, an' heard me tell him to keep out of here.
An' let me tell you Pop knows more about us than
he lets on; an' he's as venomous as a snake when
he gets riled. An' he ain't th' only one that knows
things.</p>

<p>"Now we'll add it up: If we can scare Nelson away,
or discourage him, he'll quit of his own accord; an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
he won't talk because he knows that somebody knows
he's been rustlin'." He turned on his heel. "Am I
plain enough?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," called Ackerman. "That feller
has got me worried. Mebby it would be reckless to
let him disappear up here; but suppose I go on a spree
in town when he's there? It's easy to start a fight
with a gunman, because he's got to toe th' mark. I
can do th' job open an' above board, an' make it natural;
an' that will keep us clear."</p>

<p>"Jim," smiled Quigley, "I don't want to lose you;
an' if you pick a square fight with that man, th' even
break that you demand in yore personal quarrels, we
<i>will</i> lose you. I looked down his gun, an' I tell you
that I didn't see him move. He's a <i>gun</i> man!"</p>

<p>Ackerman laughed. "We won't say anythin' about
<i>that</i>. But if he did get th' worst of it in an even break
an' a personal quarrel, would it hurt us up here?
That's all I want to know."</p>

<p>Quigley thought deeply and made a slow and careful
reply. "If it wasn't bungled I don't see how it
could. You'd have to rile him subtle, make him declare
war an' be th' injured party yoreself; an' you'd
want witnesses. But don't you do it, Jim; not nohow.
I got a feelin' that he's th' best man with a Colt in
this section. Yo're a wizard with a six-gun; but you
ain't good enough for him. When he's around yo're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in th' little boy's class; an' I ain't meanin' no offense to
you, neither."</p>

<p>Ackerman, hands on hips, stared at Quigley's back
as he walked away. "Th' h&mdash;l you say!" he snorted
wrathfully. "'Little boy's class,' huh?" He wheeled
and turned a scowling face to his friend Fleming.
"Did you hear that? I calls that rubbin' it in! I
got a notion to take that feller's two guns away from
him an' make Tom eat 'em! D&mdash;d if I don't, too!
You ride to town with me an' I'll show you somethin'
you won't never forget!"</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to say that the time
soon came when he did show Fleming something; and
that Fleming never did forget it.</p>

<p>Mr. Quigley smiled grimly as he entered the house,
for it was his opinion that Mr. Ackerman had no
peer in his use and abuse of Mr. Colt's most famous
invention. He hardly could ask Mr. Ackerman to
sally forth and engage in a personal duel with a common
enemy, for it would smack too much of asking
a friend to do his fighting for him. He believed that
leadership is best based when it rests upon the respect
of those led. He had no doubt about the outcome
of such a duel, for he implicitly believed that the stranger,
despite his vaunting two guns, had as much
chance against Mr. Ackerman's sleight-of-hand as an
enraged rattler had against a cool and businesslike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
king snake. The appropriateness of the simile made
him smile, because the rattler is heavily armed and
calls attention to the fact, while the king snake is
modest, unassuming, and sounds no war-cry. Two
guns meant nothing to Mr. Quigley, because he knew
that one was entirely sufficient in the hand of the
right man.</p>

<p>He had carefully pointed out the way for Mr. Ackerman
to proceed in such a situation, and then warned
him in an irritating way not to go ahead. So now he
sighed with relief at a problem solved, for his knowledge
of Mr. Ackerman's character was based upon
accurate observations extending over a long period
of time.</p>

<h2 id="VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
FLEMING IS SHOWN</h2></div>


<p>Johnny got up at noon, and when he saw the
sign on his door its single word "Vamose" told
him that the valley and the cabin were of no further
use to him; that the time for subterfuge and acting
a part was past. That the rustlers were not certain
of his intentions was plain, for otherwise there would
have been a bullet instead of a warning; and he was
mildly surprised that they had not ambushed him to
be on the safe side.</p>

<p>It now remained for him to open the war, and
warn them further; or to pretend to obey the mandate
and seek new fields of observation. Pride and
anger urged the former; common sense and craftiness,
the latter; and since he had not accomplished his
task he decided to swallow his anger and move. Had
he been only what he pretended to be, Nelson's creek
would have seen some stirring times. As a sop to his
pride he printed a notice on a piece of Charley's wrapping
paper and fastened it on the door. Its three,
short words made a concise, blunt direction as to a
certain journey, popularly supposed to be the more
heavily traveled trail through the spirit world. Pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>ing
part of his belongings on Pepper, he found room
to sit in the saddle, and started off for an afternoon
in Hastings, after which he would return to the cabin
to spend the night and to get the rest of his effects.</p>

<p>When he rode into town he laughed outright at the
sign on Pop's door, and he laughed harder when he
saw another on Charley's door; and leaving his things
behind Pop's saloon, he pushed on to Devil's Gap. At
the ford he met the two happy anglers returning and
they paused in mid-stream to hold up their catch.</p>

<p>"You come back with us," grinned Pop. "We'll
pool th' fish an' have a three-corner meal. Where
was you goin'?"</p>

<p>"To find you," chuckled Johnny. "I'm surprised
at th' way you both neglects business."</p>

<p>"Comin' from you that makes me laugh," snorted
Pop.</p>

<p>Charley grinned. "Did you see that whoppin' big
feller I got? Bet it'll go three pounds."</p>

<p>"Lucky if it's half that," grunted Pop. "If I'd 'a'
got that one <i>I</i> had hold of, we'd 'a' had a three-pounder,
or mebby a four-pounder."</p>

<p>Charley snorted. "Who ever heard of a four-pound
brook trout? Been a brown, now, it might 'a'
been that big."</p>

<p>"Why, I caught 'em up to eight pounds, back East,
when I was a kid!" retorted Pop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yo're a squaw's dog liar!" snapped Charley.
"Eight-pound brook trout! You must 'a' snagged a
turtle, or an old boot full of mud!"</p>

<p>"Bet you five dollars!" retorted Pop, bristling.</p>

<p>"How you goin' to prove it?" jeered Charley.
"Call th' dead back to life to lie for you?"</p>

<p>"Reckon I can't prove it," regretted Pop. "But
when a man hangs around with a liar he shore gets
th' name, too."</p>

<p>"Nobody never called me a liar an' got off without
a hidin'!" snapped Charley. "I may be sixty
years old, but I can lick you an' yore whole fambly if
you gets too smart!"</p>

<p>Pop drew rein, his chin whiskers bobbing up and
down. "I'm older'n that myself; but I don't need no
relations to help me lick you! Get off that hoss, if
you dares!"</p>

<p>"Here! Here!" interposed Johnny. "What's th'
use of you two old friends mussin' each other up?
Come on! I'm in a hurry! I'm hungry!"</p>

<p>"I won't go a step till he says I ain't no liar!"
snapped Charley.</p>

<p>"I won't go till he says I caught a eight-pound brook
trout!"</p>

<p>"Mebby he did&mdash;how do <i>I</i> know what he did when
he was a boy?" growled Charley, full of fight. "But
I ain't no liar, an' that's flat!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who said you was, you old fool?" asked Pop
heatedly.</p>

<p>"You did!"</p>

<p>"I didn't!"</p>

<p>"You did!"</p>

<p>"Yo're a liar!"</p>

<p>"Yo're another!"</p>

<p>"Get off that hoss!"</p>

<p>"You ain't off yore own yet!"</p>

<p>Johnny was holding his sides and Pop wheeled on
him savagely. "What th' h&mdash;l <i>you</i> laughin' at?"</p>

<p>"That's what <i>I</i> want to know!" blazed Charley.</p>

<p>"Come on, Charley!" shouted Pop. "We'll eat
them fish ourselves. It's a fine how-dy-do when age
ain't respected no more. An' th' next time you goes
around callin' folks liars," he said, shaking a trembling
fist under Johnny's nose, "you needn't foller <i>us</i> to do
it on!"</p>

<p>Down the trail they rode, angrily discussing
Johnny, the times, and the manners of the younger
generation.</p>

<p>When Johnny arrived at the saloon and tried the
door he found it locked. He could hear footsteps
inside and he stepped back, chuckling, to wait until
Pop had forgiven him; but after a few minutes he
gave it up and went around to try the window of a
side room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"What you think yo're doin'?" inquired a calm
voice behind him.</p>

<p>He wheeled and saw a man regarding him with
level gaze, and across the street was a second, who
sat on one horse and held fast to another.</p>

<p>"Tryin' to get in for a treat," grinned Johnny, full
of laughter. "Had a spat with Pop an' Charley, an'
cussed if they ain't locked me out!"</p>

<p>The stranger showed no answering smile. "That
so?" he sneered. "Reckon you better come along
with me, 'round front, till I hears what Hayes has to
say about it. <i>I</i> don't believe he's home."</p>

<p>Johnny's expression changed from a careless grin
to an ominous frown. "If you do any walkin' you'll
do it alone."</p>

<p>Several people had been drawn to the scene and
took in the proceedings with eager eyes and ears, but
were careful to keep to one side. Jim Ackerman had
a reputation which made such a location very much a
part of discretion; and the two-gun man had been well
discussed by Pop.</p>

<p>"I finds you tryin' a man's window," said Ackerman.
"So I stopped to ask about it. As long as I've
took this much trouble I'll go through with it. You
comin' peaceful, or must I drag you around?"</p>

<p>"Mebby that's a job you'd like to tackle?" replied
Johnny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm aimin' to be peaceful," rejoined Ackerman,
his voice as smooth as oil; "but I allus aim to do what
I say. You comin' with me?"</p>

<p>"If yo're aimin' to be peaceful, yo're plumb cross-eyed,"
retorted Johnny, slouching away from the wall.</p>

<p>Quick steps sounded within the building and a frightened,
high-pitched voice could be heard, "Couple of
bobcats lookin' for holts," it said. "That feller Nelson
is pickin' on somebody else."</p>

<p>The window raised and Pop stuck his angry face out
to see what was going on; and his wrinkled countenance
paled suddenly when he saw Ackerman, and
the look in his eyes. He had a trout in one hand and
a bloody knife in the other, and both fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"Jumpin' mavericks!" he whispered. "It's Ackerman!
What's wrong, Jim?" he quavered.</p>

<p>"You saved us a walk," replied Ackerman, not taking
his eyes from the flushed face of his enemy. "I
caught <i>him</i> tryin' to open that window."</p>

<p>Charley thrust his head out as Pop replied. "We
was playin' a joke on him. It's all right, Jim. Much
obliged for yore unusual interest."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad of <i>that</i>," smiled Ackerman; "but
he looked <i>suspicious</i> an' I reckoned I ought to drag
him around an' show you what I <i>found</i> tryin' to bust
in. But if you <i>say</i> it's all right, why I reckon it <i>is</i>!"</p>

<p>"I reckon it ain't!" snapped Johnny, enraged at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
his humiliating position and at the way Ackerman accented
his words. "An' if that itchin' <i>trigger</i>-finger
of <i>yourn</i> wants to get <i>busy</i> it has my permission," he
mimicked "Pop," he said, sharply, "who <i>is</i> this
buzzard?"</p>

<p>"No need to get riled over a thing like that," faltered
Pop.</p>

<p>"Shut yore trap!" snapped Charley, battle in his
eyes. "That's Ackerman, relative of Quigley's; th'
best six-gun man in th' country."</p>

<p>"Thanks," growled Johnny, staring through narrowed
lids at Ackerman, who stood alert, his lips
twitching with contempt. "When a dog pesters me I
kick him; if he snaps at me I shoot him. I'm goin'
to kick you to yore cayuse an' yore friend." He had
been sliding forward while he spoke and now they
stood face to face, an arm's length apart.</p>

<p>Ackerman suddenly made two lightning-like movements.
His left hand leaped out to block his enemy's
right in its draw, while his own right flashed down
to his gun. As his fingers closed on the butt, Johnny's
heavy Colt by some miracle of speed jabbed savagely
into the pit of the scheming man's stomach with plenty
of strength behind it, and Ackerman doubled up like
a jackknife, his breath jolted out of him with a loud
grunt. Johnny's right hand smacked sharply on his
enemy's cheek, left vivid finger marks, which flashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
white and then crimson, and continued on down; and
when it stopped a plain, Frontier Colt peeked coyly
from his hip at the surprised and chagrined gentleman
across the street, who had been instructed to remain
a noncombatant; and had no intention, whatsoever,
of disobeying Ackerman's emphatic order. To
reveal his status he quickly raised his hands and
clasped them on the top of his hat, which is a more
comfortable position than holding them stiffly aloft.</p>

<p>Ackerman was dazed and sick, for the solar plexus
is a peculiarly sensitive spot, and his hands instinctively
had forsaken offense and spasmodically leaped to the
agonized nerve center.</p>

<p>"Turn around!" snapped Johnny viciously.
"<i>Pronto!</i> There's dust on th' seat of yore pants."</p>

<p>Ackerman groaned and obeyed, and the hurtling
impact of a boot drove him to his hands and knees.</p>

<p>"Get agoin'!" ordered Johnny, aflame with anger,
slipping the right hand gun back into its holster and
motioning with the other.</p>

<p>Ackerman, his eyes blazing, started on his humble
journey, assisted frequently by the boot; and having
crossed the street, he paused.</p>

<p>"Get up on that cayuse!" crisply ordered Johnny,
making motions which increased the mounted man's
uneasiness.</p>

<p>The further Ackerman had crawled the angrier he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
had become, and tears of rage streaked the dust on
his face. At Johnny's last command and the kick
which accompanied it, his good sense and all thought
of safety left him. He arose with a spring, a berserker,
trembling with rage, and reached for his gun with
convulsive speed while looking into his enemy's weapon
with unseeing eyes. There was a flash, a roar, and
a cloud of smoke at Johnny's hip, and a glittering six-shooter
sprang into the air, spinning rapidly. Ackerman
did not feel the shock which numbed his hand,
but leaped forward straight at his enemy's throat.
Johnny swerved quickly and his right hand swung up
in a short, vicious arc. Ackerman, too crazed to avoid
it, took the blow on the point of his jaw and dropped
like a stone.</p>

<p>Johnny stepped back and looked evilly at the man
on the horse.</p>

<p>"Gimme yore gun, butt first. Thanks. You work
for Quigley?"</p>

<p>The other nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"Friend of this hombre?"</p>

<p>"Yes; sort of."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you cut in?"</p>

<p>"Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;" the other hesitated, and stopped.</p>

<p>"Spit it!"</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't supposed to," coldly replied the
horseman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then it was talked over?"</p>

<p>"Not particular. Jim does his own fightin', hisself."</p>

<p>"Good thing for Jim, an' you, too," retorted
Johnny. "When it's crowded I can't allus be polite.
Who put that sign on my door?"</p>

<p>"What sign?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>'m askin' <i>you</i> questions!" snapped Johnny, his
eyes blazing anew.</p>

<p>"Dunno nothin' about it," answered the other.</p>

<p>"I reckon yo're a practiced liar," retorted Johnny.
"But it don't make no difference. I'm leavin' th' valley,
for I can't fight pot-shooters an' do any work at
th' same time. Quigley don't own this country, an'
you tell him that while he's boss of that little valley,
<i>I</i>'m boss in this town. If him or any of his men come
to town while I'm here I'll shoot 'em down like I would
a snake. That means one at a time or all together; an'
if he don't believe me, you tell him I'll be here all day
tomorrow. There ain't no bushes in town, an' none
of yore gang can fight without 'em. Now you say to
him that I don't want no remarks made about what
I was doin' up there&mdash;you savvy that? If I hear of
any I'll slip up there some night an' blow him all over
his shirt. An' d&mdash;n you, I mean it!"</p>

<p>Ackerman stirred and sat up, looking around in a
dazed way. When his eyes fell on Johnny they lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
their puzzled look and blazed again with rage. He
reached swiftly to his holster, found it empty, and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Johnny regarded him coldly. "Get on that cayuse,
an' start goin'. This town ain't big enough for both
of us at once."</p>

<p>Ackerman silently obeyed, but his face was distorted
with passion. When he had clawed himself
into the saddle he looked down on the grim master of
the situation.</p>

<p>"Words are foolish," he whispered. "We'll meet
again!"</p>

<p>Johnny nodded. "I reckon so. Everybody plays
their cards accordin' to their own judgment. Just
now I got a high straight flush, so you hit th' trail,
<i>pronto</i>!"</p>

<p>He stepped aside to get out of the dust-cloud which
suddenly swirled around him, and watched it roll northward
until the dim figures in it were lost to sight around
a bend. The slouch went out of his bearing as he
straightened up and slid his gun into its holster, and
walking over to Ackerman's glittering six-shooter he
picked it up and sneered at it.</p>

<p>"I ain't surprised," he laughed, eying the ivory
handle and the ornate engraving. Wheeling abruptly
he glanced carelessly at the grinning audience and
strode to the door of Pop's saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll be d&mdash;d!" sputtered Pop, his eyes still bulging.</p>

<p>"Reckon you will," laughed Johnny, "unless you
mends yore sinful ways."</p>

<p>"What you been doin' to make Jim Ackerman pick
a fight with you?" demanded Pop, recovering his
faculties and his curiosity at the same instant.</p>

<p>"Here's his gun; an' here's his friend's," said
Johnny. "Keep 'em for 'em. They plumb went off
without 'em."</p>

<p>Pop openly admired Ackerman's weapon. "Bet
that cost a heap," he remarked. "Ain't she a
beauty?" He rubbed energetically at a leaden splotch
on the cylinder.</p>

<p>"It was in good company," replied Johnny.</p>

<p>"You got to look out for him," Pop warned. "He's
a bad Injun." Then he grinned suddenly. "But he
come d&mdash;d near bein' a <i>good</i> Injun!"</p>

<p>"Hey!" called a peeved voice from within. "If
you reckon I'm goin' to clean all these fish myself, you
better copper yore bets." Footsteps approached the
door and Charley roughly elbowed Pop aside. "That
means you, too, Nelson," he growled. "What you
mean, hangin' back at th' ford? Figger we'd have
'em all cleaned before you arrove? Well, if you aim
to eat any of 'em, you grab holt of a knife an' get
busy!" He shuffled back into the room again, mut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>tering:
"Cripes! I'm fish from my head to my heels,
an' bloody as a massacre. An' what's more, I ain't
goin' to clean another d&mdash;d one, not nohow!"</p>

<h2 id="IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
A SKIRMISH IN THE NIGHT</h2></div>


<p>Saying good night to his two friends, Johnny
rode north along the trail, but he had not ridden
more than half way to the mouth of his valley when
he swung Pepper into an arroyo which he knew led
to the south side of the butte behind his cabin. While
heavily fringed with brush and trees it was open
enough along the dry bed of the stream to permit him
to push on at fair speed, and while there were rocks
and bowlders in plenty, Pepper easily avoided them
in the soft moonlight and went on with confidence. At
last, reaching a fork, he chose the right-hand lead
and pushed on more slowly for a few minutes, and
then, picketing the horse, he slipped out of his chaps
and boots and put on the pair of moccasins which had
been hidden under the saddle flaps. Taking the rifle
from the long scabbard, he slung it across his back and
slipped noiselessly up the ravine.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he stopped suddenly and sniffed,
and then glanced quickly around him. The smoke was
very faint, but it was something to think about because
it meant either men close at hand or a forest
fire. Going on again, even more slowly, he began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to take advantage of cover, and as he proceeded the
smoke became steadily stronger. A sudden suspicion
made him set his jaws, for he was going straight up
wind and toward his cabin. Stopping a moment to consider,
he turned sharply to his left and went on again,
a Colt swinging loosely in his left hand. Anything
close enough to be seen plainly would be near enough
for the Colt, and in such poor light the six-shooter
was more accurate in his hands than a rifle.</p>

<p>The only things about him which he could hear
were the holsters, which rubbed very softly as he
walked, but the sound would not carry for any distance.
Having gone around the little valley near his
cabin, he crawled along below the ragged skyline of
the ridge and reached a point close to the cabin, when
he suddenly dropped to his stomach and flattened himself
to the earth.</p>

<p>Some restless, gambling soul could not do without
a cigarette and he had detected its faint odor in
time. Turning his head slowly, he sniffed deeply and
swore under his breath, for he was going partly with
the wind, which meant that the smoker must be somewhere
behind him. Then a gentle breeze, creeping
along the ridge in a back-draft, brought to him the
strong and pungent odor of the fire; and he nodded in
quick understanding.</p>

<p>The back-draft told him that the smoker was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
front of him and cleared up one danger; but it also
had blotted out the odor of the cigarette, and as he
started forward again he put his faith in his eyes and
ears. Slowly he moved along, a few feet at a time,
and then he caught the brief and fragrant odor again.
Worming around a great, up-thrust slab of lava he
stopped suddenly and held his breath. A speck of fire,
faint through the clinging ashes, moved in a swift,
short arc, became brighter and moved back again, a
gleaming dot of red. He could see the hand and part
of the arm of the man who had just knocked the ashes
from a cigarette in a characteristic and thoughtless
gesture. He was sitting just around the corner of a
huge bowlder not far away, his back to it, and a dull
gleam of reflected moonlight revealed the end of his
rifle.</p>

<p>From where he now lay Johnny could see the smoldering
ruins of his cabin, where the flames were low
and the flying sparks but few. A little current of air
fanned the ashes for a few minutes and sent the sparks
swirling and dancing, and the flickering, ghostly flames
licking upward with renewed life. The increased light,
fitful as it had been, brought a smile to his face; for
he had caught sight of a pair of spurred boots projecting
beyond a rock not far from the glowing embers.</p>

<p>"Ah, th' devil!" muttered the man near him. "I'm
goin' home. He's scared out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The speaker arose and stretched, and grumblingly
leaned over to pick up his sombrero, the moon lighting
his hair; and he suddenly crumpled forward and
sprawled out without a groan as Johnny's Colt struck
his head.</p>

<p>The owner of the spurred boots, down behind the
rock near the cabin, wriggled backward and looked up
to see what had made the noise, caught sight of a dim,
ghostly figure moving past a bowlder and called up
to it.</p>

<p>"Come on, Ben; let's get goin'. Where's Fleming?</p>

<p>"Thanks to my fool idea of strategy," said a peeved
voice high above the cabin, "which I borrowed from
our doughty friend, Mr. Ackerman, I'm up here,
smoked up like a ham. I ain't stuck on this. Shootin'
a good man from ambush never did set well on my
stummick. Reckon Ben's asleep, like a reg'lar sentry;
he didn't have th' cussed smoke to make things interestin'
for him. Hey, Ben!" he called, wearily.</p>

<p>"No use yellin'," warned Spurred Boots earnestly.
"He ain't asleep. I just saw him move. Up to some
of his fool jokes, I reckon; an' it's a d&mdash;d poor time
to play 'em. I'm a little nervous, an' might shoot
without askin' any questions. Comin' down?"</p>

<p>"Yo're just whistlin' I am," growled Fleming. "It's
all fool nonsense, us three watchin' an' waitin' to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
shoot that feller. When he finds his shack burned
an' his rustlin' business busted up, he'll move out without
us pluggin' him. D&mdash;n it! Didn't he say he was
done? But you just listen to th' mockin' bird: If
there's any shootin' to be done, he'll do his little, two-handed
share. I've been eddicated today; done had a
superstition knocked sprawlin'. An' so did Jim get
eddicated. He made his play for that feller's right
hand, when d&mdash;d if he ain't left-handed. It made
Jim near sick; for a minute I was scared he'd lose his
dinner. An' I allus believed left-handed men came
in third by two lengths; but lawsy me! What? I'm
insulted! I said lawsy."</p>

<p>"You shore can talk!" admired Spurred Boots.
"Sometimes a cussed lot too much. What in blazes
is Ben doin'?" he asked petulantly, stiffly arising and
working his arms and legs.</p>

<p>"Fixin' to jump out on us from behind a rock, an'
yell 'Boo!'" grunted Fleming. "Ben, he's an original
feller; allus was, even as a kid. D&mdash;n these
thorns." A thin stream of profanity came from the
crevice and Fleming slid down the rest of the way
and rolled out into the circle of illumination. "Just
like water down a chute, or a merry-hearted bowlder
down a hill. Roll, Jordan, roll. Was you askin' about
Benjamin, th' catcher of lightning? Benjamin Franklin
Gates, his name is; an' he's done gone home. He's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a sensible feller, B. F. G. is; but only in spots, little
spots, widely spaced."</p>

<p>"You talk as much as Jim Howard's wife," grumbled
Spurred Boots. "Jim he said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course he did! Wasn't it awful?" interposed
Fleming. "It was just like a man. But I think
it was me that told you that story; so we'll let it keep
its secret. As I was sayin', getting in my words edgeways
like, but shore gettin' 'em in: Ben has pulled th'
picket stake, an' like th' Arabs, done went."</p>

<p>"You mean Arapahoes."</p>

<p>"Did I? I allus call 'em that for short. Have
mercy, Jehovah!"</p>

<p>"I saw him move just before I spoke," replied
Spurred Boots positively. "But that was a long time
ago, before th' deluge, of words," he jabbed ironically.</p>

<p>"Cease; spare thy whacks. An' where th' h&mdash;l
did you ever hear of th' deluge? Some Old Timer
tell you about it?" responded Fleming. "I been seein'
things, too. All kinds of things. Some had tails but
no legs; some had legs but no tails; an' to make a
short tale shorter, that was a ghost what you saw.
A wild, woopin', woppin' ghost. Come on, Nat;
let's flit."</p>

<p>"Then my ghost lit a cigarette a long time back,"
retorted Nat Harrison. "An' then it said 'flop.' Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
they smoke cigarettes?" he demanded with great sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Some does; an' some smokes hops; an' some
smokes dried loco weed," grinned Fleming. "That
was a spark what you saw, an' th' musical flop was
a trout fish turnin' cartwheels on th' water. One of
them sparks plumb lit on th' back of my neck, an' I
cussed near jumped over th' edge an' made a 'flop'
of my own for myself. An' it's a blamed long walk
home," he sighed.</p>

<p>"There's th' lightnin's play-fellow now! See him,
up there?" demanded Harrison. "Must 'a' been
off scoutin'. Hey, Ben! Wait for us&mdash;be right up."</p>

<p>Fleming glanced up as another vagrant breeze
fanned the embers, and he forthwith did several things
at once, and did them quite well. Sending Harrison
plunging down behind a rock by one great shove, he
jumped for another and fired as he moved. "Ben
h&mdash;l!" he shouted, firing again. "I've seen that
hombre before today. Keep yore head down, an' get
busy!"</p>

<p>Two alert and attentive young men gave keen scrutiny
to the ridge and wondered what would happen
next. Thirty minutes went by, and then Harrison
rolled over and over, laughing uproariously.</p>

<p>"Cussed if it ain't funny!" he gurgled. "'Some
smoke cigarettes, some smokes hops, an' some smokes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
dried loco weed!' Ha-ha-ha! An' I reckon yo're still
seein' them woopin' woops."</p>

<p>"You'll see somethin' worse if you moves out into
sight," retorted Fleming. "That ghost that <i>I</i> just
saw was a human that ain't got to th' ghost state yet.
If you don't believe me, you ask Ackerman, if you've
got th' nerve."</p>

<p>Harrison rose nonchalantly and sauntered over
toward the embers. "Come on, Art; I'm cussed near
asleep," he yawned.</p>

<p>"You acts like you was plumb asleep, an' walkin'
in it," snapped Fleming angrily. "But it's a good
idea," he admitted ironically. "You stay right there
an' draw his fire, an' I'll pull at his flash. You make
a good decoy, naturally; it comes easy to you. A
decoy is an imitation. Stand still, now, so he can line
up his sights on you. <i>I</i>'m all ready."</p>

<p>Harrison grinned and waved his hand airily.
"There ain't no human up there," he placidly remarked.
"An' I don't care if Benjamin F. is there:
she goes as she lays. What you saw was a bear or a
lobo or a cougar come up to see th' fire, an' hear you
orate from th' mountain top. They'll go long ways
to see curious things. In th' book, on page eighteen,
it says that they has great streaks of humor, an' a
fittin' sense of th' ridiculous. Animals are awful curious
about little things. An' on page thirty-one it says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
they has a powerful sense of smell; an' you know you
was up purty high. An' I ain't lookin' forward with
joy unconfined to gropin' along no moonlit trail with
th' boss of th' wolf tribe, or other big varmits sneakin'
around. I might step on a tail an' loosen things up
considerable. They're hell on wheels when you steps
on their tails, poor things."</p>

<p>"La! La!" said Fleming sympathetically. "Just
because you have got yore head out of th' window it
don't say you ain't goin' to get no cinder in yore eye.
A lead cinder. Lemme tell you that animal wore
pants an' a big sombrero. I tell you I <i>saw</i> him!"</p>

<p>"It was one of them sparks," grunted the other,
enjoying himself. "One of 'em that plumb lit on th'
back of yore neck. A spark is a little piece of burnin'
wood which soars like th' eagle, an' when it comes
down makes sores like th' devil. Te-de-dum-dum!
Howsomeever, if yo're goin' with me, yo're goin' to
start right now&mdash;I've done it already," and he walked
slowly toward the creek.</p>

<p>Fleming arose and hesitated, scanning the ridge
with searching eyes. Then he stepped out and followed
his friend, who already was across the creek
and climbing the steep bank.</p>

<p>After reaching the top of the steep part of the
ridge he glanced about over the great slope and then
paused for breath and reflection, peering curiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
toward the tree-shaded hollow where he had seen the
much-debated movement. Obeying a sudden impulse
he drew his gun and went cautiously forward, bent
low and taking full advantage of the cover. A deep
groan at his side made him jump and step back. Cautiously
peering over a large rock he started in sudden
surprise, swearing under his breath. Benjamin Franklin
Gates, neatly trussed and gagged, lay against the
rock on its far side, and his baleful eyes spoke volumes.
There came a soft step behind Fleming and he
wheeled like a flash, his upraised gun cutting down
swiftly, and came within an ace of pulling the trigger
at Harrison, who writhed sideways and snarled at him.
Then Harrison also saw the bound figure on the ground
and swore with depth, feeling, and vigor.</p>

<p>"Smokes dried loco weed!" he jeered sarcastically,
his voice barely audible. "I feels uncomfortable, entirely
too present," he whispered, sinking quietly to
the ground.</p>

<p>"Which is unanimous," remarked Fleming, with simple
emphasis. "Ben, he ain't sayin' nothin'," he added
cheerfully.</p>

<p>An angry gurgle came from the bound figure and it
rolled over to face them. Harrison grinned at it.
"Under other circumstances I could enjoy this unusual
situation," he remarked softly.</p>

<p>"Face to face with Ben, an' him not sayin' a word,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
marveled Fleming, his eyes busy with the rock-strewn
slope. "But I can almost hear him think. Twinkle,
twinkle, little star&mdash;wonder where Mr. Two-gun Nelson
is located at this short, brief, an' interestin' second?"</p>

<p>Another gurgle slobbered from the bound man and
his heels thumped the ground.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Harrison, tensely. "I hears me a
noise!"</p>

<p>"I hears me it, too," said Fleming. "But not a
word; not a soft, harsh, lovin', long, short, or profane
word. Not even a syllable. Not even th' front end
of a syllable. All is silent; all but that mysterious
drummin' noise. An' if it was farther away I'd be
quite restless."</p>

<p>A coughing gurgle and a choked snort came from the
base of the rock, and then a louder, more persistent
drumming.</p>

<p>"An' you said Benjamin had done snuk home," accused
Harrison. "I'm surprised at you. He's been
here all th' time. How could he snuk when he's hog-tied,
which is appropriate? Gurgle, gurgle, little man&mdash;I'll
untie you if I can." He bent over, cut loose the
gag, slashed the belt from the trussed feet and severed
the neckerchief from the crossed wrists. "There!
There! Not so loud!" he gently chided.</p>

<p>"Blankety dashed blank blank!" said Ben Gates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
"Dashed blankety dashed blank blank! What th'
h&mdash;l you want to cut that belt for, you dashed dashed
blankety blank of a dash! Three dollars done gone to
th' devil! Just because you got a blankety-blank knife
do you have to slash every dashed-dashed thing you
see!"</p>

<p>"Sh!" whispered Fleming. "We know yo're
grateful; but what happened?" he breathed, too busy
to look around.</p>

<p>"Shut yore face!" ordered Harrison, trying in vain
to stare through a great, black lava bowlder which lay
on the other side of a small clearing.</p>

<p>"Dashed blank!" said Benjamin. "It's been shut
enough, you d&mdash;d pie-faced doodle-bug!"</p>

<p>"Yes; yes; we know," soothed Fleming; "but what
happened?"</p>

<p>"Leaned over to get my blankety-blank hat and a
dashed tree fell on my blank head!" He felt of the
afore-mentioned head with a light and tender touch;
and the generous bump made him swear again.</p>

<p>"It's that prospectin' rustler," enlightened Fleming,
gratis, as he peered into the shadows behind him.</p>

<p>"No!" said Gates. "I reckoned it was General
Grant an' th' Army of th' Potomac! Dead shore it
wasn't Columbus?" he sneered.</p>

<p>"It was not Columbus, Benjamin," said Fleming.
"Columbus discovered America in 1492 or 1942&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>some
time around there. Ain't you heard about it yet?
An' somehow I feels like a calf bein' drug to th'
brandin' fire. I feels that I'm goin' to get somethin'
soon; an' I ain't shore just what it's goin' to be."</p>

<p>"You'll get it, all right," cheered Harrison, anger
in his voice withal. "It'll be a snub-nosed .45, if you
don't shut up yore trap. You ain't openin' no Fourth
of July celebration, or runnin' for Congress."</p>

<p>Ben felt for his gun and cursed peevishly. "My
guns are gone: lend me one of yourn!" he said.</p>

<p>"Th' gentleman has quite a collection," chuckled
Harrison. "Three Colts an' a Winchester. Good
pickin', says he. Good enough, says I. True, says he;
but, he says, I have hopes of more. Ta-ta! jeers I."</p>

<p>"Shut <i>yore</i> face!" growled Fleming, writhing.</p>

<p>"I want a gun, an' I wants it now!" blazed Gates,
pugnaciously.</p>

<p>"Fair sir, how many guns do you think we pack?"
demanded Harrison.</p>

<p>"You got a rifle an' a Colt!" snapped Gates. "I
wants one of 'em!"</p>

<p>"He only wants one of 'em," said Fleming.</p>

<p>"I was scared you'd be a hog," said Harrison.
"Here; take this Winchester, an' <i>keep</i> it. Bein' generous
is all right; but it has its limits."</p>

<p>Gates gripped the weapon affectionately and sat up.
"No use of stayin' here like we done took root," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
said, rising to his feet. "We wants to spread out.
Mebby he's still hangin' around."</p>

<p>"Yes; an' shoot each other," growled Harrison.
"I'm goin' to spread out, all right; an' when I quits
spreadin' I'll be in my little bunk. He's a mile away
by now; but if he ain't, don't you let him have that gun;
he's got enough now."</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and their hair arose on their
heads as a long-drawn, piercing scream rang out. It
sounded like a woman in mortal agony and it came
from the ridge above them. From the upper end of
the rock-walled pasture below came a howl, deep, long-drawn,
evil, threatening. They turned searching eyes
toward the nearer sound and saw a crescent bulk silhouetted
against the moon. It lay in the top of a
blasted pine, and as they looked, it raised its chunky
head and neck and screamed an answering challenge to
the lobo wolf in the canyon.</p>

<p>Ben moved swiftly, and a spurt of flame split the
night, crashing echoes returning in waves. The crescent
silhouette in the tree-top leaped convulsively and
crashed to the ground, breaking off the dead limbs in
its fall, and then there ensued a spitting, snarling,
thrashing turmoil as the great panther scored the earth
in its agony.</p>

<p>Ben's friends forsook him as though he were a leper
and melted into the shadows, cursing him from A to Z.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
They wanted no ringing notice of their presence broadcasted,
and the flash and roar of the heavy rifle had
done just that.</p>

<p>As they faded into the darker shadows farther back
a crashing sounded in the brush and they peered forth
to see the great panther plunging and writhing through
the bushes, smashing its way through the oak brush in
desperate plunges. Reaching the edge of a small clearing
it gave one convulsive leap, another harrowing
scream and thudded against a bowlder, where it suddenly
relaxed and lay quiet.</p>

<p>"There's near a quart of corn juice up in my bunk,
an' I'm goin' for it," said Harrison, moving swiftly up
the rough trail. "I need it, an' I need it bad!"</p>

<p>"That cat's mate ain't fur away," remarked Fleming
thoughtfully. "It's due hereabouts right soon.
I'm stickin' closer than a brother, Nat. Lead me to
th' fluid which consoleth, arouseth anger and dulleth
pain; blaster of homes, causer of&mdash;of&mdash;headaches,
d&mdash;n it! Ben, he's a great hunter, a wild, untamed,
ferocious slayer of varmints; he can stay here an' argue
with th' inquirin' mate, if he wants, while we wafts yonder
an' hence. It won't be draped up in no tree, neither;
somehow I can just see it sniffin' at th' beloved
dead an' then soft-footin' through th' brush, over th'
ridges an' around th' bowlders, its whiskers bristlin',
its wicked little ears pointed back, an' its long, generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
tail goin' jerk-jerk, tremble-tremble. Lovely picture.
Fascinatin' picture. It is lookin' real hard for th' misguided
son-of-a-gun that killed its tuneful mate. Nice
kitty; pretty kitty; lovely kitty! I votes, twice, for that
whiskey. I votes three times for that whiskey. Lead
th' way, Nat; an' for my sake keep yore eyes peeled."</p>

<p>Quick, heavy steps behind them made them jump for
cover, turning as they jumped, and to peer anxiously
back along the trail.</p>

<p>Ben walked into sight, the rifle held loosely in front
of him as he peered into the shadows. "You acts like
you has springs in yore laigs," he derisively remarked.</p>

<p>"An' you acts like you had sour dough for brains,"
courteously retorted Harrison. "An' it's so sour it's
moldy. Go away from here!"</p>

<p>"Yo're a great little, two-laigged success," sneered
Fleming. "Reg'lar Dan'l Boone. I hopes if any gent
ever trails me for my scalp it will be you. You wants
to buy yoreself a big tin whistle an' a bass drum when
you go out ambushin'!"</p>

<p>"I claims that was a good shot," complacently replied
Ben. "What with it bein' near dark, an' a
strange gun, an' my head most splittin', I holds it was.
Must 'a' been to make you long-winded ijuts so d&mdash;d
jealous."</p>

<p>"Trouble is, yore head didn't split enough," grumbled
Harrison pleasantly. "It should 'a' been split<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
from topknot to chin. Next time <i>I</i> goes man-huntin',
<i>you</i> stays home with yore pretty picture books."</p>

<p>"Suits me," grunted Ben placidly. "Yore company
hurts my ears, offends my nose, an' shocks my eyes.
An' as for th' excitement, why I done got enough of
that to&mdash;<i>look out</i>!" he yelled, firing without raising
the gun to his shoulder.</p>

<p>An answering flash split the darkness between two
bowlders further up the slope and Ben pitched sideways.
His companions fired as if by magic; the instant
return fire sent Harrison reeling backward. He tripped
on a root and fell sprawling, the gun flying from his
hand. Fleming leaped toward a huge rock, firing as
he jumped, and slid behind the cover, where he sighed,
and groped for his gun with trembling hands. Groans
and muttered curses came from the trail, and Fleming,
raising himself to a sitting position, his back against a
rock, saw Harrison dragging himself toward his gun
and a clump of brush.</p>

<p>"You stay where you are," said an ominous voice,
"an' put up yore hands!"</p>

<p>Lying in a patch of moonlight, Harrison could do
nothing but obey; but Fleming nerved himself and
picked up his gun, still able to fight and only waiting
for his enemy to show himself. Several minutes passed
and then a hand darted over the rock and wrenched
Fleming's gun out of the weak hand that held it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ain't goin' to get hurt no more if you acts
sensible," said the new owner of the gun. "Where
you hit?"</p>

<p>"Thigh an' shoulder," muttered Fleming weakly.</p>

<p>The stranger fell to work swiftly and deftly and in
a short time he arose and moved toward the two men
in the clearing. "You'll be all right after yore friends
get you home," he said over his shoulder. Reaching
the two figures on the trail he first took their guns and
then looked them over.</p>

<p>"This feller with th' lump on his head is my old
friend, th' smoker," said Johnny. "He's got a crease
in his scalp. Barrin' a little blood an' a big headache,
he'll be all right after a while. Where'd I get you?"
he demanded of Harrison.</p>

<p>"Arm," grunted Harrison. "Through th' flesh.
I done tripped an' fell&mdash;must 'a' near busted a rock
with my fool head when I lit," he said, as if to explain
his subsequent inaction. "We reckoned you'd left th'
country till we found th' package you tied up an' left."</p>

<p>"I come back for th' rest of my stuff," replied
Johnny. "I was scared to come up th' valley."</p>

<p>"You acts like you'd scare easy," admitted Harrison.
"I'm sorry you ain't got more nerve," he grinned despite
the pain in his arm.</p>

<p>"Here," said Johnny, squatting beside him, "lemme
tie up that arm. I wasn't aimin' to shoot nobody till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was cornered," he grinned. "I heard what you fellers
said, back in th' valley, an' that's why. I was plumb
peaceful, tryin' to slip away, when that gent up an' let
drive at me. Bein' in a pocket made by them fool
bowlders I couldn't get out, so I had to cut down on you
with both hands. Th' dark shadows helped me a lot;
you couldn't see what you was shootin' at. An' anyhow,
I owe him somethin'. I was under that tree when
he up an' dumped that pleasant cougar down on top of
me, right in my arms. Never was more surprised in
all my life. An' to make matters worse, this is my best
pair of pants."</p>

<p>"Show 'em to me!" begged Harrison.</p>

<p>Johnny stepped back for inspection and waved his
hands at the trousers; and Harrison had to laugh at
what he saw. What was left of them formed a very
short kilt, and the underwear was torn into bloody
strips.</p>

<p>Harrison wept.</p>

<p>"I'm pullin' my stakes," continued Johnny pleasantly.
"This layout is too excitin' for a man of my bashful an'
retirin' disposition. You can tell Quigley he don't have
to set no more ambushes in that valley, an' also that th'
first time I meet him I'm goin' to smoke him up with
both hands. I'm honin' for to get a look at him, just
a quick glance. Give my regards to yore friend Ackerman;
his gun, an' that other feller's, is with Pop Hayes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
but mebby they ought to wait till I leave th' country before
they go in for 'em."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and walked slowly away,
with a pronounced limp, a present from the cougar.
When he reached the edge of the clearing he paused
and faced about.</p>

<p>"You two fellers will be all right in a little while,
an' if you can't get yore friend home, you can send
them that can. I'll take yore six-guns along with me
so there won't be no accidents; but I'll leave this rifle
over here on this rock, empty. Th' cartridges are on
th' ground on th' other side of th' rock. That cougar's
mate is some het up about now, I reckons, an' you may
need it. Better not come for it for a couple of minutes.
There's been enough shootin' already. <i>Adios</i>," and
he was gone as silently as a shadow.</p>

<p>Harrison sat cross-legged and waited considerable
more than two minutes and then walked slowly toward
the rifle. As he picked it up there came a haunting
scream and a rolling fusillade of shots from the south.
Then a distant voice called faintly.</p>

<p>"I got th' mate, an' lost th' rest of my pants.
<i>Adios!</i>"</p>

<p>"I'll be d&mdash;d!" grunted Harrison, going toward his
friend at the rock. "That feller is one cheerful hombre;
an' a white man, too. If I was Quigley, I'll bet
four bits I wouldn't show my face in Hastings till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was a long way off. No, ma'am; not a-tall. Here,
Art; you take th' gun till I go back an' see how Dan'l
Boone is comin' along. He's a rip-snortin', high-class
success, <i>he</i> is! I'll bet you he'll <i>brag</i> about droppin'
that cougar, you just wait an' see. <i>Hello</i>, you wild
jackass! How you feel!"</p>

<p>"You can go to h&mdash;l" snorted the man with the
creased scalp, sitting up. "An' I don't care a cuss
when you starts, or how you goes. I'm fond of excitement,
thrive on it an' get fat; but I serves notice, here
an' now, that I'm quittin'. Any man that takes th' trail
with you two fools is a bigger fool. Great guns! I
won't have no head left after a while!"</p>

<p>"You never did have one that amounted to anythin',"
said Harrison cheerfully. "I admit that it's a
handy place to hang a hat, but when that is said, th'
story is ended. Amen. You set right where you are
till you are able to walk, an' then we'll get Art home."</p>

<p>"Takin' Art home is what we should 'a' done long
ago; we're doin' this thing backwards, th' d&mdash;n fool!"
moaned Ben. "We'd 'a' been home long ago if it
wasn't for him."</p>

<p>"Huh?" muttered Harrison. "Well, I'll be d&mdash;d!
Say! If it wasn't for you pluggin' that cat we'd 'a' been
home, whole an' happy, sleepin' th' sleep of th' innercent.
When you got that bright idea, you shore touched
off a-plenty. He was pullin' his stakes, aimin' to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
out peaceful, when you dumped that panther right
down plumb around his neck! Man! Man! But I
wish I'd 'a' seen that! Benjamin, if you only knowed
what I'm thinkin' about you! Words ain't capable of
revealin' my thoughts; they fall far short; an' if I used
enough words I'd strain my vo&mdash;vocabulary, till it
never would be any good any more. An' I can only
swear in English, Spanish, Navajo, an' Ute. An education
must be a grand thing."</p>

<p>"Th' breaks was ag'in us," explained Benjamin.</p>

<p>"Lord, please hold me back!" prayed Harrison.</p>

<p>Well to the south of them a limping cow-puncher,
with no trousers at all now, and blood-soaked strips of
underwear pasted to his torn and bleeding legs, pushed
doggedly toward his horse, swearing at almost every
painful step and avoiding all kinds of brush as he painstakingly
held to the middle of the dried bed of the
creek. His shirt tail, cut into ragged strips, flapped in
the cold breeze where not held down by the weight of
the sagging belts and holsters; and in his hands he carried
the captured Colts.</p>

<p>Reaching his horse he fastened the extra weapons
to his saddle, carefully drew on his chaps, coiled up the
picket rope and climbed gingerly astride.</p>

<p>"Come on, Pepper!" he growled "Pull out of this.
I got a pair of pants wrapped up in that tarpaulin at
th' mouth of th' valley; an' I wants 'em bad. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
shore missed somethin' this evenin', you lucky old
cow!"</p>

<p>When day broke it revealed a shivering, grumbling
cow-puncher washing his cuts and gashes in the cold,
pure water of Nelson's creek. Retiring to the pebbly
bank, he tore up a clean shirt and used it all for bandages,
after which he carefully drew on a pair of clean
underdrawers and covered them with a pair of well-worn
trousers. The chaps came next as a protection
against whipping branches and clinging brush. Rolling
up the tarpaulin he fastened it behind his saddle and,
mounting stiffly, started for Hastings.</p>

<p>Some hours later he lolled at ease and related to the
grinning proprietor the strange and exciting occurrences
of the night. Pop was swung from one extreme
to the other as the tale unfolded, while Andrew Jackson
chuckled, whistled, and laughed until the narrator's
scratching fingers lulled him into a deep and soul-stirring
ecstasy.</p>

<p>"You shore started some fireworks," chuckled Pop
when the tale was finished. "An' yo're cussed lucky,
too. When Ackerman showed his hand yesterday I
knowed trouble was fixin' to ride you to a frazzled finish.
Now what d&mdash;d fool thing are you goin' to do?"
he demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to keep out of that valley," reluctantly
answered Johnny. "It ain't got no charms for me no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
more. They've burned my cabin, an' I reckon I got all
th' gold there was, anyhow. When my legs get well
I'm goin' to try it again somewhere else. Twin Buttes
are too unlucky for me."</p>

<p>"Now yo're shoutin'," beamed Pop. "You just set
around here an' take things easy for a few days, while
me an' Charley fixes that tarp so it'll be a pack cover
an' a tent that is one. No prospector wants to build a
shack unless winter ketches him in th' hills or he finds
a rich strike. Me an' you an' Charley will go fishin' a
few days from now an' have a reg'lar rest. I'm all
tired out, too. Business is shore confinin'." He looked
Johnny over and chuckled. "Cussed if I wouldn't 'a'
give six pesos, U. S., to 'a' seen that cougar a-fannin'
you! He-he-he!"</p>

<h2 id="X">CHAPTER X<br />
A CHANGE OF BASE</h2></div>


<p>Johnny, upon leaving Hastings, struck south from
it and spent the night west of the Circle S after a
journey of twenty miles on foot. Pepper was again a
pack horse, and the diamond hitch which held the bulging
tarpaulin in place would have dispelled any doubt
as to Johnny's abilities to cut loose from civilization
and thrive in the lonely places. And he had cut loose
when he placed a note under a rock behind a certain
tree near the ford; for when "Hen" Crosby, riding
for the mail, saw the agreed-upon sign on the tree, it
would not be long before Logan had the note.</p>

<p>Following the line of least resistance, the second day
found him bearing westerly, and the next three days
found him crowding the pack on Pepper's back and
riding due north through a country broken, wild, and
without a trail. The way was not as difficult as it
might have been because the valleys joined one another,
and through them all flowed creeks, which made a
trail that left no tracks. To an experienced man who
had plenty of time the difficulties were more often
avoided than conquered.</p>

<p>At noon of the fifth day he drove Pepper slantingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
up the wall of a crumbling butte, and, reaching the top,
looked around for his bearings. They were easily
found, for Twin Buttes looked too much alike, even
from the rear, to be easily mistaken; and they loomed
too high to be overlooked. Almost on a direct line
with the Twins lay Quigley's cabins, a matter of fifteen
miles from him; which he decided was too far.
That distance covered twice daily would take up too
much time. Returning to the valley he built a fire, had
dinner, and, hanging the edible supplies on tree limbs
for safety, whistled Pepper to him and departed toward
the Twins.</p>

<p>Two hours later he left the horse in a deep draw and
crawled up the eastern bank. Crossing a bowlder-strewn
plateau he not long afterward wriggled to
the edge of Quigley's valley and looked down into it.</p>

<p>The size of the enclosed range amazed him, for it
was fully thirteen miles long, eight miles across at its
widest, the northern end, and three miles wide at the
middle, where massive cliffs jutted far out from each
side.</p>

<p>The more he saw of it the better he liked it. The
grass was better and thicker than even that in the prized
and fought-for valley of the old Bar-20. He judged
it to contain about eighty square miles and believed that
it could feed two hundred cows to the mile. The main
stream, which he named Rustler Creek, flowed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a deep ravine and was fed, in the valley alone, by six
smaller creeks. There was a sizable swamp and six
lakes, one of them nearly a mile long. It was singularly
free from bowlders and rocks except at a place
near the upper wall, where a great collection of them
extended out from a broken cliff.</p>

<p>Except at three places the canyons which cut into
the cliffs were blind alleys and he could see that two of
them had narrow waterfalls at their upper ends. The
three open canyons were the only places where cattle
could leave the great "sink," as Johnny called it; and
they were strongly fenced. The first was the entrance
canyon, near the houses; the second was a deep, steep
walled defile at the northwest corner of the range, and
it led into another, but smaller valley, also heavily
grassed. Through it ran a small stream which joined
Rustler Creek at the swamp. The third canyon, at
the northeast corner of the valley, was wide enough to
let Rustler Creek flow through it and leave room for
the passing of cattle; and judging by the gates in the
heavy fence which crossed it, Johnny knew this to be
the exit through which the drive herds went. Where
that drive trail led to he did not know, but he believed
it to pass well to the west of Hope.</p>

<p>Taking it all in all, it was the most perfect range
he ever had seen. Rich in grass so heavy and thick
as to make him wonder at it, naturally irrigated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
blessed with natural reservoirs, surrounded by a perpendicular
wall of rock which at some places attained
a height of three hundred feet, the water courses lined
with timber, its arroyos and draws heavily wooded, and
with but three places, easily closed and guarded, where
cattle could get out, it made the Tin Cup and the Bar-20,
large as they were, look like jokes. Its outfit could
laugh at rustlers, droughts, and blizzards, grow fat and
lazy and have neither boundary disputes nor range
wars to bother them. There were no brands of neighboring
ranches to complicate the roundups and not a
cow would be lost through straying or theft.</p>

<p>Having located the valley, he slipped away, mounted
his horse and rode back the way he had come, looking
for a good place to pitch his camp. Five miles from
the valley he found it&mdash;a cave-like recess under the
towering wall of a butte, half way up the wooded slope
which lay at the foot of the wall. From it he could
command all approaches for several hundred yards,
while his tarpaulin would be screened by bowlders and
trees. It was high enough for purposes of observation,
but not so high that the smoke from his fire would have
density enough when it reached the top of the butte to
be seen for any distance. A spring close by formed
pools in the hollows of the rocks below him. The great
buttes lying to the east of the fire would screen its light
from any wandering member of Quigley's outfit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is it," he grunted. "We'll locate here tomorrow."</p>

<p>The following day, having put his new camp to
rights, he rode up the western slope of the great plateau
which hemmed in Quigley's ranch, picketed his horse
in a clearing, and after a cautious reconnaissance on
foot he reached the edge of the cliffs, and the valley lay
before him. Cattle grazed near a little lake, but at
that distance he could not read the brands. He first
had to find out if any of the outfit ever rode along the
top of the cliffs, and he struck straight back to cross
any such trails. By evening he had covered the western
side of the ranch without finding a hoof-print, or a
way up the sheer walls where a horseman could reach
the top. There were several places where a cool-headed
man could climb up, and at one of these Johnny
found several burned matches.</p>

<p>The next day was spent on the plateau north of the
ranch, and the third and fourth days found him examining
the eastern side; and it was here that he found
signs of riders. There were three blind canyons on
this side, and the middle one had a good trail running
up its northern wall, and it appeared to be used frequently.
At the top it divided, one branch running
north and the other south. It was the only place on
that side of the valley where a horseman could get out.</p>

<p>Now that he had become familiar with his surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>ings
he began his real work. If Quigley had rustled,
the operations could be divided into two classes: past
operations, now finished; or present operations which
were to continue. It was possible that enough cattle
had been stolen in the past so that the natural increase
would satisfy a man of modest ambitions. In this case
his danger would decrease as time passed and eventually
he would have a well-stocked range and be above
suspicion. If he were avaricious the rustling would
continue, if only spasmodically, until he had made all
the money he wanted or until his operations became
known.</p>

<p>Johnny early had discovered that Quigley's brand
was QE and this increased his suspicions, for the E
could not be explained. Logan's brand was childishly
simple to change: The C could become an O, Q, G,
or wagon-wheel; the L would make an E, Triangle,
Square, or a 4.</p>

<p>Satisfied that the foundation of Quigley's brand had
been the CL, Johnny had to discover if Logan's cattle
still were being taken to swell the Quigley herds. Logan's
inaction and his easy-going way of running his
ranch jarred Johnny, for the foreman had confessed
that for the last few years the natural increase, figured
in the fall roundups, had not tallied with the number
of calves branded each preceding spring. But Logan
was not altogether to blame, because the Barrier had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
given him a false security and there was nothing to fear
from other directions. It was the last spring roundup
and its tally sheets which had stirred him; and a close
study of his drive-herd records and the use of the factor
of natural increase suddenly brought to his mind a
startling suspicion. Even then he wavered, fearing that
he was allowing an old and bitter grudge to sway him
unduly; and before he had time to make any real investigations,
Johnny had appeared and demanded a job.</p>

<p>Among Quigley's cattle the proportion of calves to
cows was so small that Johnny could not fail to notice
it. He was satisfied that the QE, so prominently displayed,
originally had been CL, but when he caught
sight of a crusty old steer near the mouth of the second
canyon all doubts were removed. While the mark
was an old one, the rebranding had been done
carelessly. The segment which closed the original
C had not been properly joined to the old brand,
and there was a space between the ends of
the two marks where they overlapped. A look
at the ears made him smile grimly, for Logan's
shallow V notch had become a rounded scallop; and
there was no honest reason why Quigley should notch
the ears of his cows when there was no chance of them
getting mixed up with the cattle of any other ranch.
The scallop had been made simply to cut out the telltale
V notch.</p>

<h2 id="XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
NOCTURNAL ACTIVITIES</h2></div>


<p>Light gleamed from Quigley's ranch-houses and
an occasional squeal came from the corral, suggesting
that "Big Jake" was getting up steam for more
deviltry. Occasionally a shadow passed across the
lighted patches of ground below the windows and the
low song of Rustler Creek could be heard as it swirled
into the long, black canyon. Save for the glow of the
windows and the rectangles of light below them everything
was wrapped in darkness, and the canyon, the
range, and the rims of the cliffs were hidden.</p>

<p>"<i>A miner, 'forty-niner, and his daughter, Clementine</i>,"
came from the middle house as Art Fleming
dolefully made known the sorrowful details of Clementine's
passing out. He put his heart into it because
he had troubles of his own, for which he frankly and
profanely gave Ben Gates due discredit.</p>

<p>Ben, tiring of the dirge, heaved a boot with a snap-shooter's
judgment and instantly forsook the heavy inhospitality
of the house for the peace and freedom of
the great outdoors. He plumped down on a bench and
immediately arose therefrom.</p>

<p>"Look where yo're settin', you blunderin' jackass!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
snarled a hostile voice from the same bench. "Yo're
as big a nuisance as a frisky bummer in a night herd!"</p>

<p>"A bull's eye for Mr. Harrison," chanted the man
inside.</p>

<p>"You two buzzards are about as cheerful an' pleasant
as a rattler in August," snapped Gates belligerently.
"Like two old wimmin, you are, <i>both</i> of you! Settin'
around in everybody's way, tellin' yore troubles over
an' over again till everybody wishes Nelson had done a
better job. How'd <i>I</i> know you was sprawled out,
takin' up all th' room? You reminds me of a fool dog
that sets around stickin' its tail in everybody's way, an'
then howls blue murder when it's stepped on. Think
yo're th' only people on this ranch that has any troubles?"</p>

<p>"A miss for Mr. Gates," said the irritated voice
within the house. "An' if he will stick his infected
head in that door, just for one, two, three, he'll have
more troubles," prophesied Mr. Fleming, facing the
opening with a boot nicely balanced in his upraised
hand. "If it wasn't for him, we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up! <i>Shut up!</i>" yelled Gates, enraged in an
instant "If you says that much more I'll bust yore
fool neck! For G&mdash;d's sake, is that all you know, Andrew
Jackson?"</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for you," said the man on the bench
very deliberately as his hand closed over a piece of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>wood,
"I said, if&mdash;it&mdash;wasn't&mdash;for&mdash;you, we'd be
ridin' with the boys tonight, instead of stayin' around
these houses like three sick babies."</p>

<p>"Another bull's eye for Mr. Harrison," said the
man inside.</p>

<p>Gates wheeled with an oath. "An' if it wasn't for
<i>you</i> sound asleep in th' valley; an' Fleming sound asleep
up on that butte, I wouldn't 'a' been lammed on th' head
an' tied up like a sack! It's purty cussed tough when
a man with nothin' worse than a scalp wound has to
lay up this way!"</p>

<p>"Bull's eye for Mr. Gates," announced the man in
the cabin, with great relish.</p>

<p>"If you'd been wide awake yoreself," retorted Harrison,
"you wouldn't 'a' been tied up! You didn't even
squawk when he hit you, so we'd know he was around.
Was you tryin' to keep it a secret?" he demanded with
withering sarcasm. "An' as for them bandages, how
did <i>I</i> know th' dog had been sleepin' on 'em? Cookie
gave 'em to me!"</p>

<p>"Bull's eye for Mr. Harrison," said Fleming.
"But he was awake," he continued with vast conviction.
"He was wide awake. He ain't got no more
sense awake than he has asleep. When he's got his
boots on, his brains are cramped an' suffocated."</p>

<p>"You got him figgered wrong," said Harrison.
"His brains are only suffocated when he sets down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>While the little comedy was being enacted at the
bunk-houses, the main body of rustlers followed Quigley
down the steeply sloping bottom of a concealed
crevice miles north of the ranch-house of the CL. The
five men emerged quietly and paused on the edge of
the curving Deepwater, and then slowly followed their
leader into the icy stream. The current, weakened
by a widening of the river at this point, still flowed
with sufficient strength to make itself felt and the slowly
moving horses leaned against it as they filed across
the secret ford. Reaching the farther bank the second
and third men rode quietly to right and left, rapidly
becoming vague and then lost to sight. The three remaining
riders sat quietly in their saddles for what, to
them, seemed to be a long time. Suddenly a low whistle
sounded on the left, followed instantly by another
on the right; and like released springs the rustlers
leaped into action.</p>

<p>Vague, ghostly figures moved over the open plain,
finding cows with uncanny directness and certainty.
Two riders held the nucleus of the little herd, which
grew steadily as lumbering cows, followed inexorably
by skilled riders, pushed out of the darkness. There
was no conversation, no whistling now, nor singing, but
a silence which, coupled to the ghost-like action and
the dexterous swiftness, made the drama seem unreal.</p>

<p>There came an abrupt change. The two men riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
herd saw no more looming cattle or riders, which
seemed to be a matter of significance to them, for they
faced southward, guns in hand, and pushed slowly back
along the flanks of the little herd. Peering into the
shrouding gray darkness, tense and alert, eyes and ears
straining to read the riddle, they waited like sooty
statues for whatever might occur, rigid and unmoving.</p>

<p>A sudden thickening in the night. A figure seemed
to flow from indefinable density to the outlines of a
mounted man. A low voice, profanely irritant, spoke
reassuringly and grew silent as the rider oozed back
into the effacing night.</p>

<p>"Shore," muttered a herder, relaxing and slipping
his gun into its holster. He moved forward swiftly
and turned back a venturesome cow. His companion,
growling but relieved, shrugged his shoulders and settled
back to wait.</p>

<p>Minutes passed and then another lumbering blot
emerged out of the dark, became a cow, and found reassurance
in numbers as it willingly joined the herd.
The escorting rider kept on, pushed back his sombrero
and growled: "They're scattered to h&mdash;l an' gone tonight;
but," he grudgingly admitted, "they acts plumb
do-cile. S'long."</p>

<p>Another wait, long and fruitless, edged anew the
nerves of the herders. Then Quigley, Ackerman, and
Purdy moved out of the obscurity of the night and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
up positions around the herd, urging it forward. When
they had it started on its way, Ackerman dropped back
and became lost to sight, engaged in his characteristic
patrolling, suspicious and malevolent.</p>

<p>The little herd, skilfully guided over clean patches
of rock which led deviously to the water's edge and left
no signs on its hard surface, at last reached the river,
where a shiver of hesitancy rippled through it and where
the rear cows pushed solidly against the front rank,
which appeared to be calling upon its inherent obstinacy.
The craft and diplomacy of Quigley's long experience
won out and the uncertain front rank slowly and grudgingly
entered the stream, the others following without
noticeable hesitation. As the last cow crossed and scrambled
up the western bank, Ackerman rode down to the
water's edge, pushed in and crossed silently, only the
lengthening ripple on the black surface telling of his
progress. As he climbed out he squirmed in his wet
clothes and swore from sudden anger, which called
forth a low ripple of laughter from the base of the
Barrier, where the others took their discomforts lightly.</p>

<p>"Scared you'll shrink, Jim?" softly said an ironic
voice.</p>

<p>"Or dissolve, like sugar?" inquired another scoffingly.</p>

<p>"Sugar?" jeered a third. "Huh! He's about as
sweet as a hunk of alum!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Ackerman's retort caused grins to bloom unseen, and
the miseries of wet clothes and chilled bodies were
somewhat relieved by the thought that Ackerman felt
them the most.</p>

<p>Up the crevice in orderly array, docile as sheep,
climbed the cattle, and when they reached the top of the
plateau they moved along stolidly under guidance and
finally gained the outer valley leading to the QE by a
trail west of and parallel to the one which showed the
way to Hastings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Back on the QE, Fleming and his friends, having
awakened the cook at an unseemly hour by their noise,
finally turned in and found some trouble in getting to
sleep, thanks to the energetic efforts of the boss of the
kitchen, who most firmly believed in the Mosaic Law,
and had the courage of his convictions. But things
finally quieted down and peace descended upon the
ranch.</p>

<p>Outside the bunk-house and behind it, a blot on the
ground stirred restlessly and slowly resolved itself into
a man arising. He moved cautiously along the wall
toward the lighted cook shack and then sank down
again, hand on gun, as the door opened.</p>

<p>Cookie threw out a pan of water, scowled up at the
starry sky and then peered intently at a chicken-coop,
visible in the straggling light from the door, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
which a sleepy cackle suddenly broke the silence. Muttering
suspiciously he reached behind him and then
slipped swiftly toward the shack, a shotgun in his hands.
Going around the coop he stood up and shook his fist
at the darkness.</p>

<p>"You can dig up my traps, an' smell out my strych-nine,
but you can't dodge these buckshot if ever I
lays th' sights on you. Dawg-gone you, I owes you
a-plenty!" he growled. Striking a match he looked in
the coop and around it. "Had two dozen as nice pullets
as anybody ever saw, only three weeks ago; an'
now I only got sixteen left. <i>There</i>, blast you!" he
swore, as the second match revealed the telltale tracks.
"There they are! O, Lord! Just let me get my gun
on that thievin' ki-yote! Just once!"</p>

<p>He stared around belligerently and went slowly back
to the house, swearing and grumbling under his breath.
It is the cook's fate to be the sworn enemy of all
coyotes, and let it be said without shame to him that he
seldom is a victor in that game of watchfulness and
wits. And also let it be said that often with tears of
rage and mortification, and words beyond repetition,
he pays unintentional tribute to the uncanny cunning of
the four-legged thieves. With guns, dogs, traps, and
poison is he armed, but it availeth him naught. And
as bad as the defeat are the knowing grins of the rest
of the outfit who, while openly cheering on the doughty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
cook, are ready to wager a month's wages on the
coyote.</p>

<p>The man on the ground moved again, this time toward
the canyon, and soon was feeling his way along
the great eastern wall. Reaching the other end, he
stopped a moment to listen, and then went on again,
groping along by the edge of the stream until he stumbled
over a dead branch, which he picked up. Then
feeling for and finding a certain rock, he stepped on it
and with his foot felt for and found another, which
was partly submerged in the creek; and by means of
this and others he crossed dry-shod to the opposite
bank, using the branch as a staff.</p>

<p>Daylight was near when Johnny wriggled to the
edge of the cliff opposite the houses and hid behind a
fringe of grass on the rim. An hour passed and then
his keen ears caught distant sounds. Below him the
cook was rearranging his traps and swearing at the
cleverness of his four-footed enemy. Suddenly he
arose and hastened to the kitchen to serve a hot breakfast
to the men who soon drove a bunch of cattle out of
the canyon and into the small corral.</p>

<p>While the others hastened in for their breakfast,
Quigley and Ackerman loitered at the corral.</p>

<p>"Purty good for five men, with one of 'em playin'
sentry," said Quigley. "We'd do better if we didn't
have to scout around first."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Scoutin's necessary," replied Ackerman. "It's too
wide open. This bunch ain't worth gettin' wet for.
That river's cussed cold!"</p>

<p>Quigley chuckled. "Huh! I've swum it when th'
ice was comin' down."</p>

<p>"You did," retorted Ackerman. "That was th'
night Logan burned our houses. You had to swim an'
freeze, or stay out an' get shot. You went in <i>pronto</i>,
that night!"</p>

<p>"You beat me in by forty yards, an' out by sixty!"
snapped Quigley.</p>

<p>Ackerman ignored the remark. "Not satisfied with
nestin' on a man's range, you had to start a little herd.
We didn't bring no cows with us, nor buy any afterward&mdash;but
what's th' use? Let's eat," and he led the
way toward the cook shack.</p>

<p>Johnny waited a few minutes and then, returning to
his horse, started for his camp. He was puzzled, for
no place near Big or Little Canyons was devoid of shelter,
and he knew of no other places where cattle could
pass the Barrier. He had noticed that the backs of the
cows were dry, which meant that they had forded the
river, and he was certain that the crossing had not
been made at the ford near Devil's Gap. He had to
learn the location of the place they visited and that unknown
ford; and he wanted to learn the date of their
next raid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll have to trail 'em, Pepper," he growled.
"An' then bust all runnin' records to get Logan an'
th' boys. Get agoin'; I'm sleepy."</p>

YEASTY SUSPICION</h2></div>


<p>Ackerman walked to the small corral, where
two straight irons were in a fire and where three
men were cinching up in preparation. Fleming, Harrison,
and Gates, lolling on the ground, kept up a running
fire of comment, and Ackerman stopped and
looked down at them.</p>

<p>"Three cheerful fools," he grinned.</p>

<p>"Here's Little Jimmy," remarked Fleming; "an'
by all th' Roman gods, he's actually grinnin'! Look,
fellers! Behold an' ponder! Mr. Ackerman wears a
smile!"</p>

<p>"Sick?" solicitously inquired Harrison.</p>

<p>"Drunk?" suspiciously questioned Gates.</p>

<p>"Three children," grunted Ackerman, "An' scabby.
Two sentries an' a hunter."</p>

<p>Holbrook poked the fire. "Kit Carson, Dan'l
Boone, an' Californy Joe. Three scouts. Th' ambushin'
trio."</p>

<p>"Faith, Hope, an' Charity," chuckled Purdy.</p>

<p>"You called it," grinned Holbrook.</p>

<p>"If Custer had only had 'em," said Ackerman,
"there'd been no massacre."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted Gates. "What could I do, with
them two fools herdin' with me?"</p>

<p>"Not so much herdin' with you, as tryin' to herd
you," said Harrison blithely.</p>

<p>Gates sought escape by creating a diversion, and
shouted: "Hey, look at him!" and pointing at the
cook, who staggered past under a great load of saplings
and poles.</p>

<p>"Hey, Cookie!" he shouted stentoriously. "Why
don't you put them birds in th' house nights, an' sleep
in th' coop, yoreself?"</p>

<p>"Or give him some of that there strych-nine that we
got for you?" yelled Sanford. "There's a lot of it
left," he chuckled, remembering the cook's futile rage
when he had found the poisoned carcass half covered
over with dirt.</p>

<p>The cook, his glistening face crimson, carefully lowered
the forward end of the poles to the ground, eased
them upright with his shoulder and wiped the perspiration
from his face with a grimy sleeve. Turning a red
countenance toward his grinning friends he started to
speak, muttered something, spat forcibly, shouldered
carefully under his load again and staggered away with
as much dignity as he could command.</p>

<p>"That's right, Cookie," commended Gates. "Don't
you waste no words on 'em a-tall. They're a lazy,
worthless, shiftless lot. If they wasn't they'd help you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
tote them trees. But I wish you'd tell me what yo're
aimin' to do, because if yo're goin' to rig up a scaffold
for that ki-yote, I want to be around when he's hung."
He turned and surveyed the group. "You ought to
be ashamed of yoreselves, lettin' him tote that load hisself.
He works harder than any man on this ranch,
an' I can prove it. I can prove it by him. What with
buildin' stockades an' scaffolds, diggin' holes for his
traps, poisonin' baits, an' settin' up nights with his shotgun,
he's a hard workin' member of this outfit. He
ain't got no time to set around an' loaf all day like some
I could name if I had a mind to."</p>

<p>"Hard workin'!" snorted Purdy. "That ain't
work; that's fun! He's as happy doin' that as others
is playin' cards or somethin'. He'd get mopey if that
ki-yote died. A man allus works harder at his fun
than he does at his work. Allus!"</p>

<p>"Shore!" grunted Holbrook. "I've seen men so
lazy that they growled because th' sun kept 'em movin'
to stay in th' shade; but show 'em a month's good
huntin' an' they'd come to life quick! They'll climb
an' hoof it all day to get a shot at somethin'; but if
their wife asked 'em to rustle a bucket of water you
could hear 'em holler, clear over in th' next county."</p>

<p>"Would you look at him settin' them poles!"
chuckled Gates. "He's shore goin' down to bed-rock!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Holbrook pulled an iron out of the fire, glanced at
it, shoved it back again and arose. "Let her go," he
said.</p>

<p>At the word two men vaulted into their saddles and
rode into the corral. A cow blundered out and was
deftly turned toward the fire, and at the right instant
a rope shot through the air, straightened and grew
taut; and the cow, thrown heavily, was hog-tied,
branded, its ears cut to conform to the QE notch, and
released in a remarkably short time. Arising it waved
its lowered head from side to side and started to charge
Holbrook. Gates stepped quickly forward, kicked a
spurt of dirt in its face and a clever cow-pony sent it
lumbering out through the gate in the fence and onto
the range.</p>

<p>"Maverick," grunted Holbrook, waiting for the
next. "Logan shore is careless in his calf roundups.
That's four of 'em we got in th' last two raids. Reckon
he thinks brandin' is more or less unnecessary, th' way
he's located. An' d&mdash;d if here don't come another!
Nope; it's a sleeper. Somebody took th' trouble to
cut th' notch."</p>

<p>Ackerman did his share of the work, silent and preoccupied,
and when the last cow had been turned onto
the range he wheeled abruptly, looked around, and
walked over to Quigley, who was approaching.</p>

<p>"I reckon I better go off on a little scout," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
"I ain't satisfied about Nelson; an' th' more I mills
it over, th' less satisfied I am. You can grin; but I'm
tellin' you it ain't no grinnin' matter!" he snapped,
eying the group. "I'm tellin' you what I'm goin' to
do, an' that's all."</p>

<p>"That's for you to say," smiled Quigley. "Nobody's
goin' to try to stop you; but we reckon yo're
only makin' trouble for yoreself. He's quit th' Twin
Buttes country. I understand he's prospectin' south of
town."</p>

<p>"He ain't prospectin' none," retorted Ackerman.
"An' he wasn't prospectin' up here, neither; he was
runnin' a bluff, an' makin' it stick. <i>I</i> looked into that
gravel bed!"</p>

<p>Fleming laughed. "He was coverin' his rustlin'
operations. His real prospectin' was to be done with a
rope an' a runnin' iron."</p>

<p>"Yes," grunted Sanford; "an' now he's doin' th'
same thing down south, I'll bet. Th' Circle S has got
a lot of sleepers an' mavericks runnin' on their out-lyin'
range. Holmes has been threatenin' for two years
to round 'em all up; but when he's ready, th' Long T
ain't; an' t'other way around."</p>

<p>"Our friend is goin' to set right down on a rattler
if he starts rustlin' down there," grinned Purdy.
"Them two ranches are wide awake. I know, because
I've looked 'em over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'll tackle th' job," said Harrison; "because he's
somethin' of a pinwheel hisself."</p>

<p>"That's how I figger it," said Holbrook quickly.
"A burned child loves th' fire, if it's stubborn. Let
him alone; don't stir him up. We don't want him up
here, an' that's our limit. What he does down there
ain't no game for us to horn into. Let 'em fiddle an'
dance an' be d&mdash;d."</p>

<p>Ackerman regarded them pityingly and shrugged his
shoulders. "I pass! Ain't there no way to get it
through yore heads that I don't believe he's interested
in anythin' but <i>us</i>? It's like drillin' in granite. I hammer
an' hammer, twist th' drill an' hammer some more;
an' after hard work all I got is a little hole, with a
cussed sight more granite below it! I feel like rammin'
in a charge of powder an' blowin' it to h&mdash;l an' gone.
<i>Look</i> at me! <i>Listen!</i> Put away yore marbles, an'
<i>think!</i>"</p>

<p>"Why don't you fellers listen?" grinned Fleming.</p>

<p>"Just because he went south don't say he <i>stayed</i>
there," hammered Ackerman. "He wasn't scared
away; not by a d&mdash;d sight. <i>I</i> know that. Fleming,
Gates, an' Harrison know it. We <i>all</i> know it. He
went south. But he can turn, can't he? If he can't,
he's in a h&mdash;l of a fix! No tellin' where he'll end up&mdash;Patagonia,
mebby. All right, he can turn. It's only
a question of <i>where</i>! He's goin' to turn; an' when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
does, <i>I</i>'m goin' to be there an' see him do it. I'm goin'
to make it my business to find him, watch him, an' trail
him. If he turns north I'm goin' to <i>get</i> him. An' if
you'll take any advice from me, you'll all begin to
take long rides, north, east, south, an' west; mostly
southwest an' west. You'll ride in pairs, an' you'll keep
yore fool eyes open. Th' time has passed for loafin'
around here, shootin' craps an' swappin' lies. Yo're
smokin' on an open powder keg; an' <i>d&mdash;n you</i>, you ain't
got sense enough to know it!" He raised his clenched
fists. "I <i>mean</i> it! D&mdash;n&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;ain't&mdash;got&mdash;sense&mdash;enough&mdash;to&mdash;know&mdash;it!"</p>

<p>Quigley laughed, although uneasily; for Ackerman's
earnestness carried unrest with it. "Jim, Jim," he
said kindly, "we've been up here a long time; an' we've
given these hills a name that guards 'em for us. Them
that bothered us disappeared; an' th' lesson was
learned."</p>

<p>"Was it?" shouted Ackerman. "<i>He</i> didn't learn
it! <i>He</i> come up here, plump in th' face of yore warnin',
in spite of what he had heard in Hastings! <i>Why?</i>
Because it's his <i>business</i> to come! Because he's <i>paid</i> to
come! <i>He</i> ain't one of them Hastings loafers! <i>He</i>
ain't no sleepy puncher, satisfied to draw down his pay,
an' th' h&mdash;l with th' ranch! I tell you you never <i>saw</i> a
man like him before. Can't you see it? Logan found
out that he was a <i>real</i> man, a gun man, an' not scared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of h&mdash;l an' high water. Then he quits Logan, an'
comes up here. Can't you <i>see</i> it? <i>Can't</i> you? <i>Think</i>,
d&mdash;n it; THINK!"</p>

<p>"I did; have been, an' am," snapped Quigley angrily.
"Thinkin' is one thing; goin' loco, another. <i>I</i>
think yo're a d&mdash;d fool!"</p>

<p>Ackerman threw up his hands in a helpless gesture.
"All right; have it yore own way. I give it up. I pass
before th' draw. But I ain't swallerin' no pap an'
gazin' at th' moon. I'm goin' to keep my eyes on Nelson."</p>

<p>"You want to; he's a bad hombre," said Fleming
uneasily.</p>

<p>Ackerman wheeled and smiled at the speaker. "He
is; an' he's a d&mdash;d <i>good</i> man. I takes off my hat to
him; an' I wish to heaven we had a few Nelsons up
here; this ranch would <i>hum</i>. An' you'd 'a' done
better if you'd follered yore own advice. I won't make
th' same mistake twice. Th' minute he makes a false
move I'll plug him. I underrated him before; now I'm
goin' to overrate him, to be on th' safe side. But you
ain't got a thing to say: three to one, an' you let him
make fools out of you!"</p>

<p>"I admits it," said Fleming. "An' that's why I'm
tellin' you to look out for him. He's as quiet as a flea;
an' as harmless as blastin' powder. I wish you luck."</p>

<p>"I ain't so harmless myself," retorted Ackerman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
"An' now I know what I'm buckin'. You'll see me
when you see me; I'm preparin' to be gone a month or
more."</p>

<p>They watched him enter the bunk-house, and when
he came out again he had his saddle and a blanket roll;
and when he rode into the canyon without a backward
glance or a parting word he had his slicker, a generous
supply of food, and plenty of ammunition.</p>

<p>Quigley watched him until he rode out of sight beyond
the canyon, and turned toward his outfit, shaking
his head. "He's so all-fired set on it that I'm gettin'
a little restless myself. Jim ain't no fool; an' he don't
often shy at a shadow. It won't do us no harm, anyhow;
an' we can take turns at it. I'll start it off by
takin' one side tomorrow, an' Holbrook can take th'
other. Later on we'll figger it out an' arrange th'
shifts. Mebby he's right."</p>

AN OBSERVANT OBSERVER</h2></div>


<p>Jim Ackerman strode into Pop Hayes' saloon,
where he found the proprietor and Charley James
squabbling acrimoniously over the value of a cribbage
hand.</p>

<p>"Not satisfied with gettin' a twenty-four hand,"
snorted Charley, "he tries to make it twenty-seven,
shovin' 'em around like he was playin' three-card
monte! You old fool! You've counted them runs
once more'n you oughter; but I don't care how much
you mills 'em; it's twenty-four!"</p>

<p>"I ain't done no more countin' than they'll stand!"</p>

<p>"I dunno what <i>they'll</i> stand; but I knows what <i>I</i>'ll
stand. It's twenty-four!"</p>

<p>"Soon as you gets two bits up," sneered Pop, "you
lose yore nerve. You can play all day for fun, an'
never loose a yelp; but when you've got money up you
acts like you was stabbed!"</p>

<p>"That so? You forget how to count when there's
money up!"</p>

<p>"When yo're winnin' everything is lovely; but when
yo're losin' you go on th' prod!"</p>

<p>"You don't have to go; yo're allus rarin' around on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
yore hind laigs, a-pawin' th' air an' snortin'. Leave it
to Ackerman. I dare you!"</p>

<p>"I'll leave it to anybody but you. You hadn't ought
to even play for th' drinks. Jim, look at that twenty-seven
hand an' tell that fool what it counts, will you?"</p>

<p>Ackerman moved it around and grinned. "Fifteen
eight; two pairs is twelve, an' four runs of three makes
that twenty-seven hand count just twenty-four. An' it's
a cussed good hand, top; you shore knows how to discard."</p>

<p>Charley nodded emphatically. "There! I told you
so!"</p>

<p>Pop raised his hands helplessly to heaven. "How
much longer have I got to keep th' peace? Two more
like you an' Charley an' this country would go plumb
to th' dogs! Yo're two fools."</p>

<p>"Now who's stabbed?" jeered Charley. "You
can get more out of one crib hand than most folks can
find in two. 'Four, five, six,'" he mimicked. "Why
don't you shift 'em around an' work six, five, four; an'
five, six, four; an' four, six, five? A genius like you
ought to get thirty-six out of a twenty-four hand an'
never turn a hair. I'm such a stranger to a hand like
that that I'd be satisfied with twenty-four. I ain't no
genius at figgers."</p>

<p>"If I told you what you are, you'd get insulted!"</p>

<p>"Anybody that could insult you could make cows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
live on malpais an' get fat," sneered Charley. "I've
done called you a liar, an' a cheat, an' a thief&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hey! Stop that!" interposed Ackerman. "Quit
it; an' have a drink with me. You'd let a man die of
thirst, <i>I</i> believes."</p>

<p>Pop shuffled around behind the bar and sullenly produced
the bottle and the glasses. "I know, Jim," he
apologized; "but you don't know how my patience gets
tried!"</p>

<p>Charley snorted. "If they ever tries yore patience
they'll lynch it. Here's how, <i>Jim</i>."</p>

<p>"Good luck," said Jim, tossing off the drink.</p>

<p>Charley, walking back toward the card table, caught
sight of the well-loaded horse outside; and Pop, taking
advantage of the situation, reached swiftly under
the bar and slid two Colts toward Ackerman, who
frowned and pushed them back. "Some other time,"
he growled. "Ain't goin' back right away." He
pushed his hat back on his head. "Any news?"</p>

<p>"There ain't never any news in this place," answered
the proprietor. "But I hear as how th'
Circle S has fired Long Pete Carson for stayin' drunk.
Long Pete was all het up over it an' lets drive at
Holmes. Bein' unsteady he missed Dick an' nicked
Harry Kane. Then Dick took th' gun away from him
an' give him a beatin'. Dick's hands are shore eddicated.
Th' Long T near lost three hosses in that quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>sand
near Big Bend; an' Smith come near goin' with
'em. An' that Nelson is prospectin' somewhere near
th' Circle S, if he ain't left th' country."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that he's mebby left th'
country?" inquired Ackerman casually.</p>

<p>"He had his spirit busted when his cabin burned.
Said this country was too full of dogs for a white man
to live in. But I reckon he'll work around th' Circle
S or th' Long T a while before he quits for good."</p>

<p>Charley turned and grunted derisively. "That's all
you know about it. He crossed the river near th' Circle
S, over Rocky Ford, an' went to Bitter Creek hills."</p>

<p>"How'd you know he did?" demanded Pop.</p>

<p>"I was told by th' man that saw him do it."</p>

<p>"Who was that?" asked Pop, indignant because he
had not been told about it before.</p>

<p>"Yo're a reg'lar old woman," jeered Charley. "You
can guess it."</p>

<p>"Funny he didn't tell me," sighed Pop.</p>

<p>"Mebby he reckoned it was his own business," retorted
Charley. "Mebby he knowed you'd blurt it out
to everybody you saw."</p>

<p>"I keep things under my belt!"</p>

<p>"Yes; food an' likker," chuckled Charley, enjoying
himself. "If nobody come around for you to tell yore
gossip to, cussed if you wouldn't tell it to th' sky, night
an' mornin', like a ki-yote."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"So he's still prospectin'," laughed Ackerman.
"He'll starve to death."</p>

<p>"I ain't so shore about that," said Charley. "He
weighed his gold on my scales an' it was one pound an'
eleven ounces. It was all gold, too; I saw it."</p>

<p>"He-he-he!" chuckled Pop. "If yore scales said
one eleven he only had about half a pound. Them
scales are worse than a cold deck."</p>

<p>"That's a lie; an' you know it! Them scales are
honest!"</p>

<p>"Then they ain't 'pervious to their 'sociations,"
grinned Pop. He reached behind him, picked up a
package and turned to Ackerman. "Did you say you
was goin' near th' Circle S?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"He did not," said Charley gleefully. "Didn't I
say you was an old woman?"</p>

<p>Ackerman laughed, winked at Charley and went out;
and the two cronies listened to the rapidly dying hoof-beats.</p>

<p>Pop wheeled and glared at his friend. "Now you've
done it! Ain't you got no sense, tellin' <i>him</i> where
Nelson is?"</p>

<p>"If I had much I wouldn't hang out with you,"
grinned Charley. "But I got a little; an' if he crosses
th' river he won't find Nelson. A Circle S puncher saw
him hoofin' it into th' southwest. <i>Quien sabe?</i>"</p>

<p>"Sometimes you do have a spark of common sense,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
said Pop. "Sort of a glimmer. It's real noticeable in
you when it shows at all, just like a match looks prominent
in th' dark. Pick up them cards an' don't do no
more fancy countin'."</p>

<p>"Countin' wouldn't do me no good while yo're multiplyin'.
Get agoin'; I got to get my four bits back
before I go home."</p>

<p>Well to the south of the two friends in Hastings,
Jim Ackerman loped steadily ahead, debating several
things; and as he neared the Circle S range a
man suddenly arose from behind a rock. There was
nothing threatening about this gentleman except, perhaps,
his sudden and unexpected appearance; but Ackerman's
gun had him covered as soon as his head
showed.</p>

<p>"Turn it off me," said the man behind the rock,
a note of pained injury in his voice. "My intentions
are honorable; an' plumb peaceful. Yo're most scandalous
suspicious."</p>

<p>Ackerman smiled grimly. "Mebby I am; but habit
is strong. An' one of my worst habits is suspicion.
What's th' idea of this jack-in-th'-box proceedin' of
yourn? You've shore got funny ways; an' plumb
dangerous ones."</p>

<p>"Reckon mebby it does look that way," said the
man behind the rock. "I neglects caution. I should
'a' covered you first an' then popped up. That shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
how plumb innercent an' peaceful I am. Yore name's
Jim Ackerman, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"You can't allus tell," replied Ackerman.</p>

<p>"That's where yo're figgerin' wrong. I can allus
tell. Havin' told me yore name, I'll tell you mine.
I'm Pete Carson, known hereabouts an' elsewhere as
Long Pete. Some calls me Long-winded Pete; but it's
all th' same to me. Pint that a little mite more to th'
sky; thank you, sir. I was punchin' for th' Circle S,
but th' Circle S punched me; then it fired me. I've got
to eat, so I got to work. Th' Long T ain't hirin';
an' I'd starve before I'd work for Logan. I ain't no
slave, not me.</p>

<p>"I'm settin' there in th' sun whittlin' a stick an'
arguin' with myself. I was gettin' th' worst of it when
I hears yore noble cayuse. Not bein' curious I riz
up instanter an' looked plumb into yore gun&mdash;just a
little mite higher; ah, much obliged."</p>

<p>"What's all this to me?" demanded Ackerman impatiently.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm aimin' to find out I saw you
comin'&mdash;up a little more; thank you. Then I think
I got a new chance. I want a job an' I want it bad.
Hold it in yore left hand: yore right hand is tired, an'
saggin'. Any chance for a close-mouthed man up yore
way? One that does as he's told, asks no questions,
an' ain't particular what kind of a job it is? Better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
let me hold that; I can see yo're gettin' tired. Thank
you, sir. I'm desperate, an' I'm hungry. What you
say? Speak right out&mdash;I'm a grand listener."</p>

<p>Ackerman grunted. "Huh! I ain't got nothin' to
say about hirin' th' men where I work. As a matter
of fact we ain't got work enough for another man.
An' I reckon you don't understand nothin' about
farmin', even in a small way; but if yo're hungry,
why, I can fix that right soon. Got a cayuse?"</p>

<p>Pete nodded emphatically. "I allus manage to keep
a cayuse, no matter how bad things busts; a cayuse, my
saddle, an' a gun. Why?"</p>

<p>"Climb onto it an' come along with me. I'm aimin'
to make camp as soon as I run across water. That's
a purty good animal you got."</p>

<p>"Yes; looks good," grunted Long Pete; "but it
ain't. It's a deceivin' critter. I'm yore scout. There's
a crick half a mile west of here. I'm that famished
I'm faint. Just a little more an' I'd 'a' cooked me a
square meal off of one of th' yearlin's that wander on
th' edge of th' range. That was what I was thinkin'
over when I heard you."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't do a thing like that!" exclaimed
Ackerman severely. "Besides, you shouldn't talk
about it. An' if you <i>do</i> it you'll get shot or lynched."</p>

<p>"A man does lots of things he shouldn't. An' as
for talkin', I'm th' most safe talker you ever met. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
allus know where I'm talkin', what I'm talkin' about,
an' who I'm talkin' to. Now, as I figger it, I'd rather
get shot or lynched than starve in a land of beef.
What do I care about killin' another man's cows?
I'm plumb sick of workin' on a string that some bull-headed
foreman can break; an' I'm most awful sick
of workin' for wages. <i>I</i> ain't no hired man, d&mdash;n
it! What I wants is an equal share in what I earns.
An' you can believe me, Mister Man, I ain't noways
particular what th' work is. I never did have no respect
for a man that gambled for pennies. No tin-horn
never amounted to nothin'. He can't lose much;
but yo're cussed right he can't <i>win</i> much, neither. If
th' stakes are high an' th' breaks anywhere near equal,
I'll risk my last dollar or my last breath.</p>

<p>"As to what I am, you lissen to me: When I'm
sober I stays strictly sober, for months at a time; an'
when I'm drunk I like ways stays drunk for days at a
time. I ain't like some I knows of, half drunk most of
th' time an' never really sober. Me, I just serves notice
that I'm goin' off on a bender, an' I goes. An'
when I comes back I'm sober all th' way through.
Here's th' crick. An' I never get drunk when there's
work to be did. You can put up that Colt now an'
watch me get a fire goin' that won't show a light for
any distance or throw much smoke. I tell you I know
my business."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Ackerman unpacked and turned the horses loose to
graze, and by the time he was ready to start cooking,
Long Pete had a fire going in a little hollow near the
water.</p>

<p>"Now you just set down an' watch me cavort an'
prance," quoth Long Pete pleasantly. "Reckon
mebby you might not move fast enough for my empty
belly. Chuck me that flour bag&mdash;I'm a reg'lar cook, <i>I</i>
am. You just set there an' keep right on thinkin'
about me; weigh me calm an' judicial."</p>

<p>Ackerman smiled, leaned back against his saddle
and obeyed his verbose companion, pondering over
what his deft guest had said. He knew of Long Pete
by hearsay, and he now marshaled the knowledge in
slow and orderly review before his mind.</p>

<p>The cook handed him a pan, a tin cup, and a knife,
fork, and spoon. Then he waved at the pan. "Take
all you want of this grub, an' take it now. This bein'
a one-man outfit I'll eat off th' cookin' utensils&mdash;utensils
sounds misleadin', don't it?&mdash;somethin' like tonsils
or a disease. Now I warn you: dig in deep an'
take all you kin eat, for there won't be no second
helpin' after I gets <i>my</i> holt. Want yore coffee now?"</p>

<p>"Later, I reckon," smiled Ackerman. "You shore
can cook. Better take th' cup first if you wants yore
coffee now. I'll use it later."</p>

<p>"Soon as we open one of them cans I'll have a cup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of my own, an' we're goin' to open one tomorrow,"
grinned Long Pete, opening his pocketknife and attacking
the frying pan. When the pan had been cleaned
of the last morsel Pete emptied the cup, washed it in
the creek, refilled it and handed it to his companion.
Rolling a cigarette with one hand, he lit it, inhaled
deeply and blew a cloud of smoke toward the sky.</p>

<p>"Cuss me if that don't hit me plumb center," he
chuckled. "An' plumb center is th' place for it. I'd
ruther eat my own cookin' in th' open, than feed in
th' house after some dirty cook got through messin'
with th' grub. At first I thought you was another
prospector; but when I looked close I saw that you
didn't have th' rest of th' outfit. Now don't you say
nothin'. I ain't lookin' for no information; I'm givin'
it. You see, I shoots off my mouth regardless, for I'm
a great talker when I'm sober; an' tight as a fresh-water
clam when I'm drunk. A whiskered old ram
of a sky-pilot once told me that I was th' most garrulous
man he'd ever met up with. After I let him
up he explained what garrulous means; an' th' word
sort of stuck in my memory. I know it stuck in his;
he'll never forget it."</p>

<p>Ackerman coughed up some coffee. "He won't,"
he gasped. "But what&mdash;made you think&mdash;I might
be prospectin'?"</p>

<p>"Just a little superstition of mine," explained Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Pete. "There's some coffee runnin' down yore neck.
You never ought to laugh when yo're drinkin'. Good
thing it wasn't whiskey. Things allus comes in
bunches. That purty near allus holds good, as mebby
you've noticed. I have. I saw one prospector, a cow-puncher
gone loco, hoofin' it in th' dirt alongside his
loaded cayuse. Of th' two I thinks most of th' cayuse.
It was a black, of thoroughbred strain, steppin' high an'
disdainful, with more intelligence blazin' out of its big
eyes than its master ever had. So when I sees you
ridin' along with a big pack I reckoned mebby that
you must 'a' eat some of th' same weed an' had got th'
same kind of hallucernations. They's different kinds,
you know. But this is once th' rule fails. There won't
be no bunch of prospectors, an' I know why; but that's
a secret. There won't be no third."</p>

<p>Ackerman looked keenly at him through narrowed
lids, speculating, wondering, puzzled. Then he leaned
back and yawned. "<i>Is</i> there a prospector down
here?" he asked incredulously. "You don't mean it."</p>

<p>Long Pete coolly looked him over from boots to
sombrero. "I'm duly grateful for this sumptious
feed, an' I know what is th' custom when you breaks
bread with a man; but I <i>do</i> mean it; an' I don't lie
even when my words are ramblin' free. I reckon,
mebby, you ought to remember that. We'll sort of
get along better, day after day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"No offense! I was just surprised. Which way was
th' fool headin'?"</p>

<p>"Mebby I am a little too touchy. We all have our
faults. He was headin' th' same as us because we're
on his trail, right now. I sort of follered it here to
keep my hand in. You never can tell when yo're goin'
to need th' practice. Our fire is built on th' ashes of
hisn. His fire an' smoke was well hid, too. What a
two-gun cow-puncher, with a Tin Cup cayuse like that,
wants to go hoofin' off on a fool's errand for, is more
than I can figger out. But two heads are better than
one; an' a man hears an awful lot of talkin' up in Old
Pop Hayes' place. Queer old polecat, Pop is."</p>

<p>Ackerman stared thoughtfully into the fire for a few
moments. Then he looked squarely and long into
Pete's placid, unwavering eyes, and what he saw there
must have pleased and piqued him.</p>

<p>"Pete, yore habit of usin' words reminds me of a
gravel bed I once panned. It was a big bed an' I
panned a terrible lot of gravel; but you'd 'a' been surprised
if you knew how much gold there was in it. I
was a rich man until I hit town." He waved his hands
expressively. "You've said a whole lot, but it pans
out strong. Anybody that won't listen to you is a fool.
Let's have a pow-wow, without hurtin' any feelin's.
Speak plain; keep cool. What you say?"</p>

<p>Pete waited until he rolled another cigarette and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
drew in another lungful of smoke. Then he recrossed
his long legs, hitched comfortably against his saddle,
and nodded.</p>

<p>"Meanin' to swap ideas an' personal opinions, ask
questions regardless, an' if things don't come out like
we'd mebby like 'em, keep our mouths shut afterwards
an' not hold no hard feelin's?"</p>

<p>"Just that," Ackerman acquiesced. "Just what was
you aimin' at in yore talk?"</p>

<p>Pete scrutinized the fire. "Well, I hit what I was
aimin' at&mdash;you allus do with a scatter gun. An' for
th' ease of my conscience, an' th' rest of my calloused
soul, let me confess that I had a gun on you while
I was talkin' to you. One arm was folded across behind
my back an' a little old Colt was squeezin' against
my side an' th' other arm, lookin' right at you. Carelessness
ain't no sin of mine; I got enough without it.
But, shakin' some of th' gravel out, let's see what I
got.</p>

<p>"I wants a job. It's funny how many times I've
wanted a job, an' then threw it sprawlin' after I got
it. Bein' desperate, I was aimin' to stick you up an'
take your outfit. Then when you got near an' I
saw who it was, I knowed I'd have to shoot to kill; an'
first, too. That's why I didn't tackle that other feller,
too. An' just then my perverted mind says two an'
two is four. An' it most generally is. Then I knowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
you needed me. So I let th' gun slip an' got real
friendly. But, as I was sayin', I want a job. Now you
pay attention.</p>

<p>"We knows what's rumored around about Twin
Buttes; an' we knows who lives up there; an' we knows
there ain't never been no farm products come out of
that section. That's th' biggest mistake you fellers
ever made; you should 'a' run a garden. Likewise,
we knows that tin-horns don't gamble with things that
belong to other people, if th' other people packs guns.
An' 'specially they don't gamble with no cows an'
hosses. 'Tain't popular, an' folks don't like it. A
tin-horn ain't man enough to risk a bullet or a rope.
Now then, you just let me draw you th' picture of a
dream I've often had.</p>

<p>"I can see a bunch of husky cow-punchers, among
which I see myself, an' we're punchin' cows that we
never bought. We're poolin' our winnin's an' sharin'
th' risks. I can even see me rustlin' cows, an' there's
men with me that I could name if my memory wasn't
so bad. There's a big rock wall, an' a deep, swift
river that's so d&mdash;d cold it fair hurts. An' somewhere
back in th' buttes, which is in a section plumb fatal to
strangers, all but one, is a little ranch, with a drive trail
leadin' north or west. That's th' dream. Ain't it
h&mdash;l what fool ideas go trompin' an' rampagin'
through a man's mind when he's asleep, 'specially if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
he ain't satisfied to work for wages? Did you ever
have any?"</p>

<p>Ackerman grinned to hide his surprise. "Yo're
a grand dreamer, Pete. I've had dreams somethin'
like that, myself; an' so far's I'm concerned yourn can
come true; but I only got one vote. An' as I ain't
goin' back for some time, I don't know just what to
say."</p>

<p>"Not knowin' what to say never bothered me,"
chuckled Long Pete. "I can talk th' spots off a poker
deck; I'll show you how, some day. But as long as
you mentioned dreams, it reminds me of another I've
had. Not long ago, neither. I saw a two-gun prospector
leavin' an unpleasant location. He was a <i>reg'lar</i>
two-gun man; a wise feller could just see it a-stickin'
out all over him. I kept right on bein' hungry. Then,
quite a little later I saw another man, a cow-puncher,
ridin' along his trail; an' he had so much grub it fair
dazzled me. An' bein' friendly, in my dream, I up
an' tells th' second man where th' other feller was
headin'. An' if th' dream hadn't 'a' stopped there I
could 'a' told him which way th' two-gun prospector
an' his black, Tin Cup cayuse went on th' mornin' follerin'
th' day I saw him. Funny how things like that
will stick in a man's memory. An' I've heard tell that
lots of people believes in dreams, too. Seems like you
only got to know how to figger 'em to learn a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
useful an' plumb interestin' things. A fortune-teller
told me that. Why, once I dreamed that I had shot a
feller that had been pesterin' me; an' when I got sober,
d&mdash;d if I hadn't, too!"</p>

<p>Ackerman slammed his sombrero on the ground and
leaned quickly forward over the fire. "Pete, I ain't
got much money with me&mdash;didn't expect to have no
call to use it. I ain't got enough for wages for any
length of time; but I've got grub, plenty of it. An' if
you wants to make that first dream of yourn come true,
you stick to me an' with me, come what may, an' I'll
see you a member of a little ranch back in some buttes,
or we'll d&mdash;d well know th' reason why. We need
brains up there. Are you in?"</p>

<p>"Every d&mdash;d chip; from my hat to my worn-out
boots; from soda to hock," grinned Long Pete. "You
got your cayuse, yore shootin' irons, an' th' grub; I
got my cayuse, mean as it is, my guns, an' a steady-workin'
appetite. Pass them pans over; allus like to
wash things up as soon as they've been used. It'll be
yore job next meal. I believe in equal work. Better
hang up that pack&mdash;there's ants runnin' around here."</p>

<p>"Yo're a better cook than me," said Ackerman
cheerfully, as he obeyed. "You do th' cookin' an'
leave th' cleanin' up to me. I'd rather wrastle dirty
pans than eat my own cookin' any day. That fair?"</p>

<p>"As a new, unmarked deck," replied Long Pete con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>tentedly.
"An' while we're talkin' about washin' pans,
I want to say that that two-gun hombre went due north,
ridin' plumb up th' middle of this here crick. An'
since yo're trailin' him, I reckon he kept goin' right
on north. I allus like to guess when I don't know."</p>

<p>"Yo're a d&mdash;d good guesser," grinned Ackerman.
"Let's roll up in th' blankets early tonight an' get an
early start in th' mornin'."</p>

<p>"Keno. That suits me, for if there is one thing
that I can do well, it's rollin' up in a blanket. I should
'a' been a cocoon."</p>

THE END OF A TRAIL</h2></div>


<p>Johnny ducked down behind a bowlder, for a
horseman, sharply silhouetted against the crimson
glow of the sunset, rode parallel to the edge of the
cliff; and, judging from the way he was scrutinizing
the ground, he was looking for tracks. While he
searched, another horseman rode from the north and
joined him. They made a splendid picture, rugged,
lean, hard; their sharply-cut profiles, the jaunty set of
the big sombreros, their alert and wiry cow-ponies,
silhouetted against the crimson and gold sky; but to
the hidden watcher there was no poetry, no art, in
the picture, for to him it was a thing of danger, a
menace. Their voices, carelessly raised, floated to
him distinctly.</p>

<p>"Find anythin'?" asked Ben Gates ironically.</p>

<p>"Just what I reckoned I'd find, which was nothin',"
answered Harrison. "Ackerman's loco. But I reckon
it's better than loafin' around down below. I was gettin'
plumb fed up on that."</p>

<p>"It's all cussed nonsense. Nelson's cleared out for
good. He ain't no fool; an' there's too many of us."</p>

<p>"Seen th' others?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only when they left. They ought to be ridin'
back purty soon I reckon. This finishes this side,
don't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they'll comb th' west side tomorrow; an' then
take th' north end. Ridin' in daylight ain't so bad;
but I got a fine chance seein' anythin' at night. An'
I hope he <i>has</i> cleared out; a man on a bronc looks
as big as a house."</p>

<p>"Don't ride at all; lay up somewhere near th' canyon,
trail an' let <i>him</i> do th' movin'. But, h&mdash;l! He's gone
out of this country."</p>

<p>"That's just what I was aimin' to do. I could
ride within ten feet of a man in th' dark, with all th'
cover there is up here, an' not see him. Don't you
worry about yore Uncle Nat; he's shore growed up.
But it's all fool nonsense, just th' same."</p>

<p>"Oh, well; it'll make things pleasanter down below,"
grinned Gates. "It'll stop th' arguin'. Quigley's
gettin' near as nervous as Ackerman. He's gettin'
scared of shadows since Jim laced it into him.
Well, I'm goin' on; if I meets Holbrook I'll tell him
to take th' south end. So long."</p>

<p>They separated and went their respective ways, and
while Johnny watched them he suddenly heard a murmur
of voices below him, and he squirmed between
two big bowlders as the sounds came nearer.</p>

<p>"Well, we've shore combed this side," said one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of the newcomers. "An' that ends part of a fool's
errand."</p>

<p>"We shore have," grunted another. "An' it did us
good, too. We all have been gettin' too cussed lazy
for any account. I reckon a certain amount of work
is th' best friend a man has got."</p>

<p>"Mebby; anyhow, I know that my appetite is
standin' on its hind laigs yellin' for help," laughed the
third. "An' we have th' satisfaction of knowin' everythin'
is all right out here. Cussed if I couldn't eat
a raw skunk!"</p>

<p>"But that ain't what I'm drivin' at," said the first
speaker, his voice growing fainter as they rode on. "I
claims if he is workin' for th' CL he only has to get
one look in our valley to tell him all he wants to
know. If he's up here, or has been up here, that would
be enough. He wouldn't stay here day after day
like a dead dog in a well."</p>

<p>As the words died out in the distance Johnny
started to slip out from between the bowlders, when
a sharp <i>spang!</i> rang out at a rock near his waist,
and a whining scream soared skyward. An opening
made by a split in the bowlder had partly revealed his
moving body to a pair of very keen eyes on the lookout
for just such a sign. A second later the flat report
of the shot cracked against his ears, but he was on
the other side of the bowlders and leaping down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
steep hillside when he heard it. As he cleared a big
rock he landed almost upon a slinking coyote, which
instantly destroyed distance at an unbelievable speed.
It shot up the hill, over the crest, and sped like an
arrow of haze across the open table-land. Another
shot rang out and a laughing voice shouted greeting.</p>

<p>"Hi-yi! Who-o-p-e-e-e! Scoot, you streak of lightnin'!
Cookie's layin' for you with nine buckshot in
each barrel. But I'm a drunk Injun if you didn't fool
me."</p>

<p>A peeved voice raised loudly in the twilight. "Hey!
D&mdash;n you! Look out where yo're shootin'! That
slug ricochetted plumb between our heads! Ain't you
got no sense a-tall?"</p>

<p>"That's right! Start kickin'!" retorted Gates at
the top of his voice, "Didn't you ever hear a slug
before? Don't you know that th' slug you can hear
is past you?"</p>

<p>"That so? How'd <i>you</i> like to listen to one <i>now</i>?"
angrily shouted the objector. "How do <i>I</i> know that
th' <i>next</i> one is goin' past?"</p>

<p>"Ah, go to h&mdash;l!" jeered Gates. "Little things
make big bumps on <i>you</i>, you sage hen!"</p>

<p>"<i>Little</i> things!" roared a second voice. "<i>Little</i>
things! Would you <i>lissen</i> to him? It sounded like a
train of cars to me, d&mdash;d if it didn't!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thinks he's treed another cougar," laughed a third
voice.</p>

<p>The three appeared upon the plateau and rode
toward the disgruntled marksman, their hands up over
their heads in mock anxiety and surrender. Down
from the north rolled a swift, rhythmic drumming,
and Harrison, eagerly alert, his rifle balanced in his
hands, slid to a dusty stop.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Reckon it was Cookie's pet ki-yote," grinned
Gates. "There ain't nothin' with wings, even, can
beat 'em. He just melted."</p>

<p>"Yo're a d&mdash;d fool!" swore Harrison angrily.</p>

<p>"Huh! I could 'a' told you that long ago," observed
Purdy. "You just catchin' on?"</p>

<p>"I saw somethin' move," retorted Gates. "It slid
past that crack an' th' sun caught it purty fair, so I let
drive. How th' devil do you suppose <i>I</i> knowed it was
a ki-yote? Think I'm one of them mejums an' has
second sight?"</p>

<p>"Never!" chuckled Fleming. "People make mistakes,
but th' man don't live, free an' unrestrained,
that would think you had second sight. He might even
be doubtful about th' first sight. You want to practice
second <i>look</i>. Look twice, pray, an' then count ten,
Dan'l, old trapper."</p>

<p>"He oughta be penned up nights," growled San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>ford.
"He's a cussed sight more dangerous than
a plague."</p>

<p>Another rider joined them from the south. "Dan'l
Boone at it again?" he asked, grinning.</p>

<p>"He is!" snapped Purdy.</p>

<p>Harrison quieted his horse. "You fellers take
him home with you, an' keep him there. He shoots at
anythin' that moves! I'm goin' to take root right
here till he gets down below. Mebby he might take
me for somethin' suspicious."</p>

<p>"If I'd 'a' got that chicken-thief," placidly remarked
Gates, "I'd 'a' slipped it into Cookie's coop
tonight, cussed if I wouldn't!"</p>

<p>"You keep away from his coop," warned Fleming,
with a solemn shake of his head. "He's another that
shoots at anythin' that moves."</p>

<p>Holbrook looked at Harrison. "You takin' th'
north end tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I'm stayin' right here till Davy Crockett
gets down on th' range. Don't you move, Frank; he'll
likely blow you apart if you do."</p>

<p>"Glad he ain't ridin' in yore place. Good night,
fellers."</p>

<p>The group split up and four of the riders rode
toward the canyon trail.</p>

<p>"Take th' lead. Art," said Purdy. "You know
that ledge better'n we do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Holbrook and Harrison watched them disappear,
consulted a few moments and then separated.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the steep eastern bank of the
plateau, Johnny, a vague blur in the fading light, hastened
stealthily into the brush. When assured that
he was safe from observation he swung north and
made the best time possible in the darkness over such
ground, eager to reach his horse, which was picketed
more than a mile away.</p>

<p>"Huh!" he grunted. "So they're combin' th' country
an' patrolin'. Hereafter an' henceforth I've got
to play Injun for all I'm worth. An' if they comb th'
west side tomorrow I've got to move my camp at daylight."</p>

<p>To the southwest of the rustlers' ranch Ackerman
and his new friend had sworn day after day, for they
found no tracks to follow. After riding up several
creeks to their head-waters they gave up such careful
searching and went blindly ahead in the direction Ackerman
thought their enemy would take; and the ashes
of dead camp-fires from time to time told them that
they had decided right.</p>

<p>At last they came to a point due west of the little
valley of the burned cabin, and Ackerman did not
choose to pass the stream which flowed from that direction.
As the day was about done they camped on
the bank of the little tributary and planned the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
day's work. Arising early the following morning Ackerman
divided the supplies and gave part of them to
Long Pete.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, smiling grimly; "here's where we
separate. We're north of Twin Buttes, an' that means
we are about even with th' south end of our ranch.
He could 'a' turned off any place from here on because
when he got this far he had just about arrived.</p>

<p>"Now I reckon I better keep on follerin' th' big
creek, for I got a feelin' that I know purty well just
about where he's located. But we can't overlook no
bets. You foller this crick to th' end, or till you see
where he left it. An' you meet me tonight, if you can,
at th' south end of that big butte up there, th' one
with th' humpback.</p>

<p>"I've told you he's dangerous, chain-lightnin' with
his guns; an' I'm tellin' you now to make shore you
won't forget it. If you run across him, shoot first, as
soon as you see him. You can't beat him on th' draw;
an' while I don't like to shoot a man that way, I'm
swallerin' my pride in this case because he's a spy, or
else he'd never ride up th' cricks for forty miles. I
never heard of anybody bein' so cautious an' patient <i>all</i>
th' time. We got to get him; if we don't there'll be
h&mdash;l to pay."</p>

<p>"Don't you get no gray hair about me," growled
Long Pete. "I know what it means, d&mdash;n him!" A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
smile flitted across his face. "But I shore has to laugh
at th' son-of-a-gun! An' me thinkin' he was a prospector,
an' loco! I'd feel ashamed of myself if I really
<i>did</i> think he was a prospector. You see, I've seen
prospectors before. You mustn't mind me makin' a
break like that once in a while; I've had to fool so
many folks I can't sort of get my bearin's now. I'd be
prouder of gettin' a man like him than anythin' I ever
done. Did you gimme plenty of grub? All right; I'm
movin' on now. So long."</p>

<p>"So long; an' good luck," replied Ackerman, going
north along the creek.</p>

<p>Long Pete rode carefully up his own watery way,
thoroughly alert and closely scrutinizing both banks.</p>

<p>"Settin' on a cayuse, out here, don't set well on my
stummick," he muttered uneasily. "I'd mebby be
more prominent cavortin' around on a mountain top,
or ridin' upside down on th' under side of a cloud, but
I ain't hankerin' after no prominence. Nope; I'm a
shrinkin' wiolet. An' <i>splash! splash!</i> says th' bronc.
<i>Splash! splash!</i> reg'lar as a watch, for th' whole wide
world to hear, observe, an' think about. Long Pete,
yo're a fool. Long Pete, yo're several, all kinds of
fools. What you should oughta do is picket th' bronc
an' perceed with more caution, on yore belly like a
silent worm, or at least on yore kneecaps an' han's,
like a&mdash;like a&mdash;a&mdash;who th' h&mdash;l cares what? Day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
after day we been temptin' Providence. 'Hurry up!'
says he. 'Hurry be d&mdash;d!' thought I. But we hurried.
Yes sir. But it must be did. D&mdash;n th' <i>must</i>. All my
sinful life there was a <i>must</i> or a <i>mustn't</i>. It's a <i>must-y</i>
world. He-he! That ain't a bad one, or I'm a liar!</p>

<p>"All serene. Both banks lovely. Lush grass an'
mosquitoes an' <i>flies</i>. <i>Splash! Splash!</i> <i>Ker</i>-splash!
<i>Ker</i>-splash! Slop inter it, bronc. Don't mind my
stummick. Keep lungin' on, pluggin' right ahead, stubborn
as th' workin's of hell. <i>Long Pete! Long Pete!
Ker-splash! Here's Long Pete!</i> Tell him, bronc;
grease th' chute for yore boss. Even th' frogs got
more sense; they shut up when they hears us. It's a
gamble, bronc; a toss-up. Our friend, Mr. James
Ackerman, says: 'Here, Long Pete. We done
reached th' partin' of th' ways. He could 'a' left th'
crick any place, now. Over east yonder is where he
was burned out. You take that way, an' I'll go on
north where I reckon I know mebby where he oughta
be.' That's what he <i>said</i>, bronc. But what he kept a
damp, dark, deep secret was: 'But I know he ain't.
He's east, where he knows th' lay of th' land. Where
he feels at home. An' anyhow, Long Pete, you know
too d&mdash;d much about our affairs.' He's a friend of ours,
bronc; we know that&mdash;but he's a better friend of hisself.</p>

<p>"We must watch both banks, bronc; watch 'em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
close. All right; but this time we'll just bust h&mdash;l
out of Mr. Must. We'll square up, right now, for th'
way Mr. Must has horned inter our affairs all our fool
life. Come on; get out of this! That's right. Now
you stand there an' drip. I'm going to travel humble
an' quiet. I don't want no fife an' drum to lead <i>me</i> to
war; no ma'am; not a-tall."</p>

<p>Long Pete's low, muttered chatter ceased as he
wriggled through the cover. Minutes passed as he
went ahead, glancing continually at the banks of the
small creek for the telltale signs. He wormed around
some scattered bowlders and came to the edge of a
small, rock-floored clearing, where he paused.</p>

<p>A movement half-way up on a mesa close by caught
his eye, and he backed over his trail, wriggled around
the little clearing and began to stalk that particular
mesa ledge. Yard after yard was put behind him,
nearer and nearer he approached the ledge and a nest
of bowlders three hundred yards from it. The bowlders
were his objective, for, once among them, he
would have the view he wished. Leading to them was
a brush-covered ridge and toward this he cautiously
advanced, rifle at the ready and every sense alert. But
he never reached it.</p>

<p>Behind him and two hundred yards to his right a
man slowly arose from behind a rock and, resting a
rifle on the bulwark, took slow and careful aim at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
gray shirt crawling close to the ridge. There was a
flash, a puff of smoke, a sharp report. Pete, a look of
great surprise on his face, tried to rise and turn to pay
his debt, crumpled suddenly and lay inert, sprawled
grotesquely on the ground.</p>

<p>The man behind the rock mechanically reloaded and
walked slowly toward his victim, waving his sombrero
in a short arc. On his face was an expression of triumphant
joy. Up on the ledge of the mesa wall another
man arose, acknowledged the signal and began
to climb down the wall as hurriedly as safety would
permit. When he reached the prostrate figure he
found the successful marksman standing like a man
in a trance, a look of blank wonderment on his face,
his lower jaw sagging loosely.</p>

<p>"Good for you!" said the man from above; and
then he paused. "What's th' matter?" A ghastly
suspicion flashed into his mind and he leaped forward to
see who the victim was. He arose relieved, but as surprised
as his companion. "Lord! I was scared you'd
got one of th' boys, from th' way you looked! Who
th' devil is <i>this</i> feller? An' what's he doin' up <i>here</i>?
I've seen him before; who th' devil <i>is</i> he?"</p>

<p>The other drew a long breath. "It's Long Pete,
of th' Circle S; but what he's doin' up here is past me.
Look at his shirt, his hat, an' say he don't look like
Nelson from th' back! He only wears one gun, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
couldn't see that; th' grass an' brush hid it. But, just
th' same, he was stalkin' you! If you'd 'a' shoved
up yore head, he'd 'a' drilled it, <i>shore</i>!"</p>

<p>"But why should he stalk <i>me</i>?" demanded Harrison.
"He didn't have no business up here; he didn't
have no reason to sneak along, an' he didn't have no
call to stalk me! Say! Mebby he's throwed in with
Nelson! If he has, mebby his outfit has throwed in,
too! Mebby they're up here strong, an' closin' in
from all directions, for a show-down! We better warn
th' boys, an' get back to Quigley; an' d&mdash;d quick!"</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Gates. "I'll get his cayuse an'
foller close. Where's Art an' Frank?"</p>

<p>"They went on north&mdash;I'm off after 'em," snapped
Harrison. "Let his cayuse be. You hot-foot it to
Quigley!"</p>

<p>"Come on!" growled Gates, wheeling. "They may
be on both sides of th' ranch!"</p>

<p>Jim Ackerman, riding slowly along the bank of the
main creek, saw everything that could be seen by a
man with keen eyes; and he felt nervous. There was
cover all about him, good cover; and any of it might
be sheltering the man he was hunting. There was no
sense for him to ride along the bank, an inviting target
that a boy hardly could miss; there was no sense in
riding at all; so he picketed his horse and went ahead
on foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Gaining Humpback Butte, the meeting place he had
mentioned to Long Pete, he worked along its eastern
base, noiselessly, cautiously, alertly; and he stopped
suddenly as he caught sight of the ashes of a dead fire;
stopped and looked and listened and sniffed. It did
not smell like a fire that had been dead very long, he
thought; and then a playful little whirlwind, simulating
ferocity, spun across the partly covered ashes and
caught up a bit of charcoal which glowed suddenly as
if winking about what it knew and could tell.</p>

<p>Ackerman flitted back into the brush and when he
again reached the side of the butte he was north of
the camp, and had viewed it from all angles. Pausing
for a moment he started back again, on a longer
radius, and soon found Pepper's newly made tracks
in a moist patch of sand, and hurried along the trail
until he saw where it entered the creek. No need for
him to wonder which way the submerged and obliterated
trail led; for it must lead north. Otherwise he
would have met his enemy. Swearing in sudden exultation
he whirled and ran at top speed to gain his
horse.</p>

<p>Ackerman knew Humpback Butte and its surrounding
valley and canyons as he knew the QE ranch,
for he had spent days hunting all over that country;
and he knew that the great slopes of the valley grew
steadily steeper as they reached northward until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
became sheer cliffs without a single way up their walls
that a horse could master. A mile above Humpback
Butte the walls curved inward until only a scant six
hundred yards lay between them; and on the southern
side of the eastern cliff, which jutted out into the
valley, hidden behind an out-thrust point, was a narrow
canyon leading into the valley which formed the
northwestern outlet of the QE ranch. For nearly five
miles north of Humpback Butte extended the valley,
now a great, wide canyon; and not one of the several
blind canyons in its great walls gave a way out. Anyone
passing the hidden canyon would hunt in vain for
an exit and have to return again.</p>

<p>Reaching his horse, Ackerman mounted and rode
north at top speed, guiding the animal over grass as
he threaded his way in and out among the obstructions.
Speed was the pressing need now, for if he
could gain the hidden canyon before his enemy found
it on his return, he had him trapped. There was an
up-thrust mass of rock, covered with brush and scrub
timber, which lay before the entrance of the canyon;
once up on that he could command both the canyon
and the valley, the greatest range not over five hundred
yards.</p>

<p>Dismounting in a thicket close to the entrance, he
slipped to the canyon and looked for tracks. Finding
none he clambered up on the mass of rock and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
searched the valley for sight of Nelson. For a quarter
of a mile he could follow the winding creek and
he watched for a few minutes, studying the whole
width of the valley.</p>

<p>"I've beat him; an' he ain't come back yet," he
chuckled grimly. "I got five minutes to look in th'
canyon an' be dead shore!"</p>

<p>For a hundred yards the little creek flowed along
the north wall of the canyon and he wasted no time on
it; any man who would ride for forty miles in creeks
would not forsake the water for a mere hundred yards.
Running at top speed he dashed around a bend, eager
for what he would find. There was a six-foot drop in
the bottom of the canyon, and a small waterfall, where
a rider would be forced to forsake the creek to climb
the ridge. A quick glance at a wide belt of sand running
out from the ledge at a place where it had crumbled
into a steep slope told him that no one had passed
that way, and he wheeled and ran back to gain the
great pile of rock outside.</p>

<p>"Got you!" he panted triumphantly. "Yo're a
clever man, Mr. Nelson; but you can't beat a stacked
deck. Here's where I pay for a certain day in Hastings!"</p>

<p>As he reached the mouth of the canyon he heard a
crashing in the brush near where he had left his horse
and he dove into cover like a frightened rabbit. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
crashing continued and then he heard the animal tearing
off leaves, and the swish of the released branches.
As he slipped forward, cursing under his breath, the
horse emerged and walked slowly up on a ridge, where
it paused to look calmly around.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n you!" raged Ackerman, leaping forward.
"I'll learn you to stay where I put you! H&mdash;l of a
cow-pony <i>you</i> are!"</p>

<p>Grabbing the reins he kicked the horse on the ribs
and dragged it back into the thicket, where he tied
it short to a tree. As soon as the knots were drawn
tight he scurried along the ridge, slipped through a
clump of scattered brush and climbed frantically up
the side of the mass of rock. A swift glance about
reassured him, and, settling behind a rock, he patted
his rifle and softly laughed.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and then suddenly he heard a
plunging in the thicket below him. Pivoting like a
flash, he faced about and threw himself flat on the
ground, his rifle cuddled against his cheek. To his
utter amazement his own horse walked into view again,
the broken reins dangling and dragging along the
ground. A gust of rage swept over him and he came
within a hair of shooting the animal; only the need
for silence kept his tightening trigger-finger from pressing
that last hundredth of an inch. White with rage,
choking with curses, he writhed behind his breastwork,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
for the horse was on the ridge again, a bold, skyline
target for any eye within a mile.</p>

<p>"Th' journey home will be yore last!" he gritted
furiously, slipping down the steep incline as rapidly as
he dared. "We'll see if you can bust my rope, doubled
twice! If you strain at th' rig <i>I</i>'m goin' to fix, you'll
choke yoreself to death, d&mdash;n you!"</p>

<p>Driving it back into the thicket he fastened it to a
sapling with the lariat, doubled twice; and the noose
around the animal's neck was a cleverly tied slip-knot.</p>

<p>"Now, d&mdash;n you!" he blazed, kicking the horse
savagely. "Take <i>that</i>, an' <i>that</i>, an' <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>Reaching up to readjust the rope he suddenly froze
in his tracks as a crisp voice hailed him.</p>

<p>"Keep 'em up!" said Johnny, stepping into view.
"Turn around&mdash;<i>keep 'em up</i>!"</p>

<p>Cool as ice and perfectly composed, Ackerman
slowly obeyed and scowled into the muzzle of a leveled
Colt, waiting for his chance.</p>

<p>"A man that treats a cayuse like that ain't hardly
worth a bullet," said Johnny. "If you'd 'a' looked
at them reins you'd 'a' seen th' knife-pricks."</p>

<p>Ackerman smiled grimly with understanding, but
made no answer.</p>

<p>"Sorry that human ramrod ain't with you," continued
Johnny. "If I'd knowed he was a friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
yourn I'd 'a' stopped him cold down south of Hastings."</p>

<p>Ackerman scowled. "Talk's cheap. Th' man with
th' drop can find a lot to say, if he's a tin-horn."</p>

<p>Johnny slipped the Colt into its holster and slowly
raised his hands even with his shoulders. "I want you
to have an even break," he muttered. "But I ain't
goin' to stay here till that Circle S puncher blunders
onto us. I'll wait one minute. It's yore play."</p>

<p>"I've been waitin' for a chance like this," said Ackerman.
"Remember how you kicked me? I allus
pay my debts. Th' next time&mdash;" He sprang aside
with pantherish speed and the heavy Colt glinted as it
leaped from his holster and flashed in an eye-baffling
arc. A spurt of flame flashed from his hip and a rolling
cloud of smoke half hid him as he pitched forward
on his face.</p>

<p>Johnny staggered and stepped back out of the smoke-cloud
which swirled around him and fogged his vision.
A trickle of blood oozed down his cheek and gathered
in his three-days beard. Peering at the huddled
figure, he pushed his gun back into its holster and
wiped the blood from his face.</p>

<p>"There ain't many as good as you with a gun, Ackerman,"
he muttered. "Well, I got to get out of here.
Them shots will shore call some of th' others; an' I'd
rather let 'em guess than know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>He sprinted to Ackerman's horse, released it and
stripped it of saddle and bridle, turning it loose to freedom
and good grass; and then, slinging the pack of
supplies on his back, hastened to his own horse and
rode away.</p>

<p>All day long Pepper moved ahead as fast as the
country would permit, first north, then east, and finally
south; and when she was stopped in mid-afternoon she
was under the frowning wall of the southern Twin,
three miles east of Quigley's stone houses and less
than half a mile from the trail used by the rustlers
when they rode abroad.</p>

<p>The very audacity of his choice of a camp site
tended to make it secure; and it was in the section
combed by the rustlers only the day before; it was
under the most prominent landmark for miles around
and practically under the nose of the QE outfit. His
camp-fire and its almost invisible streamer of smoke
from carefully selected dry wood was screened on the
south and east by the great side of the southern Twin,
and on the north and west by the bulk of the northern
Twin; and by the time the filmy vapor reached the
tops of those towering walls it would have become
as invisible as the air of which it was a part. And because
of the tumbled chaos of rock, ridge, arroyos,
bowlders, shrubs, and trees, the little tent easily could
be overlooked by anyone passing within twenty feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been his intention the day before to watch
that out-bound trail in hope of following the next raiding
party and learning what Logan wanted to know;
but now he was forced to change his plans.</p>

<p>"All right," he muttered as he finished putting the
new camp to rights. "As long as you know I'm here,
an' are huntin' me down, it's time I showed my teeth.
I'm goin' gunnin': it's a game two can play."</p>

<p>Having had his supper and lashed a small pack of
food and ammunition on his back, he led Pepper farther
down the chasm between the two buttes and let
her graze where she pleased, knowing that she would
not stray far. Then he plunged into the tangled cover
and headed toward the entrance canyon of the QE
ranch.</p>

<h2 id="XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
BLINDMAN'S BUFF</h2></div>


<p>It was nearly dark when he came to the long slope
leading to the plateau behind the QE ranch-houses
and he went on with infinite caution, at last looking
down upon the buildings, which showed no lights.</p>

<p>Had they gone on another raid and had he missed
the opportunity of trailing them? He shook his head.
There would be no more raids until they were sure
that no one was watching them. Suddenly he grinned.
The Circle S puncher, when last seen, was going
straight toward the ranch-houses. It was simple now.
Having been told all that the Circle S man knew, they
knew that only one man was watching them and would
plan accordingly.</p>

<p>"Layin' low an' settin' traps for me," he grunted.
"Bet th' three canyons are guarded&mdash;an' that trail
down th' blind canyon farther along this wall. That's
th' easiest for me, so I'll slip up there an' look around;
but first I'll take a look down in th' main canyon."</p>

<p>A short time later he peered over the rim of the
chasm and chuckled, for a small fire, cunningly placed
so as not to shine in the eyes of anyone in the houses,
burned at the base of the great wall and made suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>cient
light to show a watching marksman every rock
and hollow across that part of the canyon.</p>

<p>"They can set in th' house at a loophole an' keep a
good watch," he muttered. "There ain't a man livin'
could cross that patch of light. An' if they're guardin'
one end they're guardin' th' others&mdash;an' I'll exchange
compliments with one bunch."</p>

<p>Squirming back from the edge he started north, and
he stopped only when the plashing of water told him
that he was near his objective.</p>

<p>"If <i>I</i> was watchin' that trail I'd stay down below,"
he thought "It would be near th' narrowest part of
the ledge an' where nobody could shoot down on me.
I know th' place, too; glad I learned th' lay of th' land
around this sink."</p>

<p>He crept forward confidently, his rifle strapped
across his back, for he decided to depend on his Colts.
Reaching the head of the trail he dropped to all fours
and crept onto it; instantly a flash split the darkness
ten feet below him, the bullet ripping through his sombrero.
He did not reply, but wriggled against the
base of the wall, where an out-cropping stratum of rock
gave him shelter. As he settled down he heard a
sound above him and a pebble clicked at his side and
bounced out into the chasm.</p>

<p>Here was a pleasant situation, he thought. They
were guarding the top of the trail when they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
have been guarding the bottom. There was an outlaw
below him and another above him, and at the
first streak of dawn he would find himself in a bad fix.
Glancing up at the sky he saw that the ledge protected
him from the man above; but it would take the man
above only half an hour to run back along the canyon,
round its upper end and appear, ready for business,
on the farther side, in which case a certain member
of the CL outfit would be neatly picked off at the
first blush of daylight.</p>

<p>"I was hell-bent to get down here," he soliloquized
in great disgust; "an' now I'm hell-bent to get back
again. What business have they got to watch <i>this</i>
end?"</p>

<p>He looked back up the trail and could see nothing.
Then he held out his hand and could not see
that. "That fool didn't see me; he <i>heard</i> me! I'm
glad I didn't shoot back. He'll wait a while, doubt
his ears an' think mebby that he's loco."</p>

<p>But Ben Gates, firing on a guess, thought he saw
what he fired at when the flash of his gun lit up the
trail in front of him. True, the smoke interfered;
but Gates was backing both his eyes and his ears.</p>

<p>Johnny waited half an hour, and then grew anxious.
His enemies were not doing anything, but appeared
to be copying the patience of the noble red men, and
waiting for dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cuss th' dawn!" mused Johnny fretfully. "If
th' feller below still thinks he heard me, th' feller up
above may get dubious an' reckon his friend pulled at
nothin'; an' he's th' man I got to gamble with an' th'
sooner th' better."</p>

<p>He wriggled backward an inch at a time until he
had gained a few yards and then he softly turned
around. Another pebble fell on the ledge close to
the place he had just evacuated. The instant he heard
it he moved a little more rapidly because he was now
east of the man above. A soft shuffle came to his
ears and he swore under his breath when the sounds
stopped at the head of the trail. The man above was
now east of him, and painfully alert.</p>

<p>Slowly arising, Johnny hugged the wall and felt
it over carefully. There were knobs and slight footholds
and small cracks in it, and he took the only way
open to him, desperate as it was. He judged the rim
to be thirty feet above him, and setting his jaws he
started to climb it. The shuffling again was heard and
it now passed to the west of him.</p>

<p>"Cuss him!" gritted Johnny. "He acts like he
don't know what to do with hisself. Why th' devil
can't he stay where he belongs?"</p>

<p>Stepping back on the trail again Johnny stooped
over and ran silently toward its upper end, thankful
that he was wearing moccasins; and he had come within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
ten feet of it when the shuffling sound again passed
him, eastward bound.</p>

<p>"There!" grumbled Johnny. "I <i>knowed</i> it. He
acts like a bobcat in a cage. All right, d&mdash;n you! I'll
give you some music to shuffle to!"</p>

<p>Finding several pebbles, he threw them, one at a
time, over the rim and about over the place where he
had found shelter. A muttered expletive came from
above and the shuffling went rapidly toward the sounds.
Below him on the trail he heard a slight stir, but ignored
it as he sprinted up the trail, silent as a ghost,
and gained the shelter of a bowlder. Here he waited,
grim and relentless, for the sentry's return.</p>

<p>Shuffle Foot was peeved, and cared not a whit who
knew it. Just because he was hitched to a fool was
no reason why he should endure asinine practical joking;
so he peered over the canyon's rim and spoke
softly:</p>

<p>"What th' h&mdash;l do you think yo're doin'?"</p>

<p>The silence below was unbroken; but the astonished
Mr. Gates longed passionately for the power of
thought transmission. It was all right for Nat Harrison
to go wandering around and braying like a jackass;
he wasn't lying almost nose to nose with the most
capable two-gun man that had ever cursed the Twin
Buttes country.</p>

<p>"'Sleep?" queried Harrison. "What did you shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
at; 'nother ki-yote?" Receiving no answer he became
exasperated. "If it was anybody but you I'd pay
some attention to it. First you shoots a cougar out of
a tree when we're all holdin' our breath to keep quiet.
Then you let drive at a measly ki-yote, which you
opined was a he-man. Next you plugs Long Pete,
thinkin' he was Nelson. An' now what do you think
you see? If I poke my head out far enough, even
though I'm <i>talkin'</i> to you, I'll bet you'd let loose at it,
thinkin' th' Lord only knows what. Why don't you
<i>say</i> something? Do you think we're playin' some
kid's game, where th' feller that keeps still longest
gets th' apple? Did you make that noise?"</p>

<p>Gates writhed in impotent rage; but he suffered in
silence, which only increased the pressure of his anger.</p>

<p>"Mebby you done shot yoreself," suggested Harrison
hopefully. "Didn't see somethin' down by yore
feet, an' shoot off yore toes, did you? What's th'
matter with yore mouth? You can use it enough, th'
Lord knows when nobody wants to hear it. <i>Say</i>
somethin', you locoed polecat."</p>

<p>The pause was fruitless, and he continued, cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Mebby he's clubbed you again," he said.
"Clubbed yore stone head with th' butt of his gun an'
gagged you with yore own handkerchief; yore very
much-soiled handkerchief. But I hardly reckon he did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
because any blow heavy enough to send a shock through
that head of yourn would 'a' been heard at th' houses,
an' I didn't hear nothin' like that. Goin' to say somethin'?"</p>

<p>Harrison chuckled, and tried again: "Well, if you
ain't talkin' I'll bet yo're thinkin'. Bet yo're wishin'
I'd find a million dollars, get elected president of th'
country an' not have nothin' to worry about all th'
rest of my life. Ain't you, Dan'l Boone?</p>

<p>"You must be scared 'most to death," he continued
after a pause. "Any time you can't find a chance to
talk you shore are in a bad fix. I'm beginnin' to lose
my temper. You make me plumb disgusted, you do.
What th' devil do you think <i>I</i> was doin' out here all
night? Think anybody got past me to go down there
for <i>you</i> to shoot at? If there's anybody down there
he come up from below an' crawled over you before
you woke up."</p>

<p>Suddenly he cocked his head on one side and listened
as a low gurgle sounded in the canyon.</p>

<p>"Cuss my fool hide!" he whispered. "Mebby he
<i>did</i> see something! Mebby somebody come <i>up</i> th'
trail, tryin' to get out of th' valley before daylight!
Mebby it wasn't Ben at all that did th' shootin'! Hey,
Ben; <i>Ben!</i> For heaven's sake, <i>say</i> something, <i>any</i>thing!"</p>

<p>Gates, stung into a blinding rage which swept aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
every thought of caution, did say something. Nature
seemed to shrink from the stream of throbbing profanity
which came shouting up out of the black canyon,
whose granite walls flung it back and forth until
the chasm reverberated with it.</p>

<p>Harrison listened, entranced, his open mouth, refusing
to shut, testifying to the great awe which held
him spellbound. Never in all his sinful life had he
heard such a masterpiece of invective, epithet, and profane
invocation. The words seemed to be alive and
writhing with venom; he almost could hear them
crackle in the air. He heard himself called everything
uncomplimentary which a frontier vocabulary saved
for just such situations. He heard his ancestors described
back to the time of Adam; sweeping up to the
present, himself, his relatives, his ambitions, habits,
and personal belongings were dissected by the man
below. And then his future and the prophesied future
abode of his spirit were probed and riddled and described
by a furious, vitriolic tongue. His hair, eyes,
ears, nose, gait, and manners were gathered up and
torn apart for microscopic examination and the descriptions
were shouted at the top of his companion's
voice, which bellowed and boomed, rasped and
coughed, screeched and shrilled down in the blackness
forty feet below him. Then there fell a sudden calm,
a silence which seemed doubly silent, unreal, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of the contrast. A convulsive, retching, strangling fit
of coughing broke it, and then a hoarse, rasping voice
asked mildly, anxiously, a mild question:</p>

<p>"Is there anything I forgot?"</p>

<p>Johnny, standing up behind the smaller bowlder
that he might not lose a word or an inflection of the
masterpiece, lost in admiration, forgetful of purpose
and the situation, danced gleefully and gave a joyous
shout: "Not a cussed thing!"</p>

<p>Harrison fired at the sound, and a sharp, lurid
flash replied to his own. He staggered back as he
fired again, and an answering flash doubled him up.
Gamely he pulled the trigger again and two spurts of
flame, so close to each other that they seemed almost
to merge, sent him staggering and reeling toward the
edge of the canyon. Tripping over an inequality in the
earth he threw out his arms, fought to regain his balance
and with a sob plunged over the wall into the
darkness below.</p>

<p>Down on the trail Gates muttered in sudden horror
as he felt the wind of the hurtling body, and he leaned
against the wall, white, sick, shaken. A muffled, sickening
sound came up from the pit, and Gates dropped
to his hands and knees, not daring to stand erect.</p>

<p>"Nat!" he cried. "<i>Nat!</i> Was that you? <i>Nat!
Nat!</i>"</p>

<p>At the top of the trail a rapier-like flash of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
split the darkness, and then a series of lurid spurts of
flame stabbed in short jets, rapidly, regular as the
ticking of a clock, marking the place where two heavy
guns crashed and jumped as they poured forth a stream
of lead down the narrow rock shelf that formed the
precarious trail. The canyon roared in one prolonged
reverberation and the bullets whined and spatted and
screamed in high falsetto as they cleared the wall or
struck it to glance out into the valley below.</p>

<p>Gates, on his hands and knees, shaken, sick with
horror, crept slowly downward, oblivious to the crashing,
rolling thunder and the flying lead.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it, Nat!" he muttered over and
over again. "I didn't mean it; not a word of it!"</p>

<p>A sharp <i>spang!</i> sounded on a rock close to his head
and a hot splinter of lead cut through his cheek. He
stopped and spat it out, his nerve returning as a cold
rage swept over and steadied him. Jerking his gun
loose he emptied it up the trail, and, methodically reloading,
emptied it again, slowly, deliberately, moving
it a little at each shot so as to cover a short arc. Another
spurt stabbed the darkness above, and his gun,
again refilled, replied to it. Again the canyon sent roaring
echoes crashing from wall to wall as flash answered
flash. Then suddenly the gun below grew silent, and
the guns above spat twice spitefully without a reply,
and they, too, ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Gates stirred and slowly raised himself on an elbow,
groping blindly for his gun. His trembling hand
struck it blunderingly and knocked it over the edge
of the trail as his numbed fingers sought to close over
it. Dazed, racked with pain, he sobbed senseless
curses as he slowly dragged himself down the trail,
desperately anxious to reach his picketed horse before
his reeling senses left him.</p>

<p>After an unmeasured interval, as vague and unreal
as an elusive dream, he stumbled over the picket rope
and sprawled full length. Arousing himself he felt
along it and managed to loosen it from around the
rock which served as a picket pin; and then, slowly,
by a great effort he crawled along the rope and staggered
to his feet to grasp the pommel of his saddle,
where he clung and rested for a moment.</p>

<p>The restless horse, scenting blood, tossed its head
and moved forward; but Gates, by a great, supreme
effort, crawled heavily into the saddle and bound himself
there with his lariat. Then, spurring clumsily,
he started the animal toward the ranch-houses, fighting
desperately to keep his wandering senses.</p>

<p>An hour later two men stole to the door of the end
house and listened, questioning each other. Actuated
by a common impulse they slipped out toward the corral,
gun in hand, and found Gates, unconscious and
weak, but alive, huddled forward on the horse's neck.</p>

<h2 id="XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
THE SCIENCE OF SOMBREROS</h2></div>


<p>Johnny rubbed his eyes and sat up, wondering.
It was still dark, but a grayness in the east told
of approaching daylight. He was puzzled, for it had
been mid-forenoon when he had gone to sleep. Unrolling
stiffly from the blanket, he sat up to listen
and to peer about him. From his thicket he could see
the tent, with the soles of his boots and part of his
blanket showing. Arising he stretched and flexed his
muscles to ease the ache of them, and then approached
the ashes of the fire, and found them and the ground
underneath to be stone cold. Rubbing his eyes, he
laughed suddenly: he had slept for nearly twenty
hours!</p>

<p>"Shore made up for th' sleep I been missin'!" he
grunted. "An' ain't I hungry!"</p>

<p>Having eaten a hearty breakfast he scouted along
his back trail, acting upon the assumption that the
Circle S puncher might have gone back again, picked
it up and followed it. Reassured as to that he started
back to camp, and on the way topped a little rise and
caught sight of Pepper grazing in the narrow canyon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"That won't do, at all," he muttered, thoughtfully.
"She's a dead give-away&mdash;an' now I can't take no
chances."</p>

<p>Returning to his camp he packed up food and spare
ammunition, and then, hurrying down the canyon, whistled
to the horse, who followed him closely, as he
searched in vain for a safe place to put her. He was
growing impatient, when he chanced to look closely
at the face of the southern Twin, and then nodded
quickly. If there was water on its top, that was the
place for the horse. Half an hour later, after some
careful climbing, he reached the high plateau, dropped
the reins down before Pepper's eyes and made a swift
examination of the top of the butte. His hopes were
rewarded, as he had expected them to be, for in a deep
bowl-like depression lying at the foot of a high steep
ridge he found a large pool, the level of which was
considerably below the high-water mark on the wall.
This meant concentration due to evaporation, and he
tasted the water to be sure that it was fit to drink.
Whistling Pepper to him, he picketed her so that she
could reach the edge of the pool and range over
enough grass to satisfy her needs, cached the pack and
departed.</p>

<p>When he reached the canyon he went around the
butte and started for his camp along its southern
side, critically examining the sheer wall as he fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the brush and the loose shale under his feet. There
was one place where he thought it possible for a cool-headed,
experienced man to climb to the top, if he put
his mind to the task and took plenty of time. Giving
it no further thought he plunged on, glad that the
horse was out of the sight of any scouting rustler and
picketed so she could not get near the edge, where she
would have shown up sharply against the sky, visible
for miles.</p>

<p>Swinging past his camp and turning to the south he
cautiously crossed the rustlers' main trail and climbed
the wall behind it, and as he went forward he tried to
figure out what his enemies thought of the situation.
If they believed that several enemies opposed them
they would be likely to stay in the houses, or not stray
far from them; but if they thought only one man
fought them they would most certainly take the field
after him. Such was his summing up; and, bearing
in mind that Long Pete, when last seen by him, was
headed toward the houses, he took full advantage of
the cover afforded.</p>

<p>Approaching the cliff by a roundabout way, he at
last wriggled to the edge and peered over. A gun-barrel
projected from the crack of the door in the
last house; a man lay behind a bowlder on the cliff
across the valley, facing eastward; and almost directly
below him a sombrero moved haltingly as its wearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
slowly climbed up the cliff at one of the few places
where it could be scaled.</p>

<p>"They've figgered right," thought Johnny; "an'
they're goin' to make things whiz for me. Red Shirt,
over there, must be a thousand yards away; but this
sink is deceivin'."</p>

<p>He looked down at the climber, who was about half
way up the bluff. "Huh! I don't want to shoot him
without givin' him a chance; but he just can't come up.
Le's see: one, two, three; an' one in th' house,
wounded, is four. There's a couple more somewhere,
layin' low I reckon, waitin' for me to move across their
sights."</p>

<p>He looked across at Red Shirt and grinned. "He's
layin' on th' wrong side of that rock an' don't know
it. I'll tell him, an' get rid of that climber at th' same
time. Hope he busts his neck gettin' down."</p>

<p>Wriggling back from the edge so that the man in
the house could not locate him by the smoke, he took
deliberate aim at Red Shirt and gently squeezed the
trigger. Red Shirt soared into the air and dove over
the bowlder headfirst and with undignified speed.</p>

<p>"Knowed it was deceivin'," growled Johnny. "Shot
plumb over him. Can't be more'n eight hundred yards.
An' that's a fool color of a shirt to wear on a job like
this."</p>

<p>Johnny's shirt had been blue, a long time back; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
now its color hardly could be described by a single adjective.
Sun, wind, and strong lye soap had taken their
toll; and it had not been washed since he had left his
little valley.</p>

<p>Wriggling back to the patch of grass, a quick glance
below showed the climber frantically descending; and
the man in the house was making lots of smoke
on a gamble. Across the valley a gray-white cloud
puffed out above the big rock and a little spurt of sand
forty feet to Johnny's left told him that Red Shirt,
too, was guessing.</p>

<p>"Must 'a' been asleep not to see my smoke," muttered
Johnny.</p>

<p>More smoke rolled up from the bowlder and soon
some pebbles not ten feet away from him scattered
suddenly, while a high-pitched whine soared skyward.</p>

<p>"He's pluggin' at every bit of cover he can see,"
mused Johnny, wriggling back behind a rock. "An'
he'll prospect that bunch of grass&mdash;<i>knowed it</i>! He
can shoot," he exclaimed in ungrudging praise; "an'
he's got th' range figgered to a foot. An' he's workin'
steady from th' north to th' south; an' when he tries
for that clump of brush over there he's got to show his
head an' shoulder."</p>

<p>A puff of dust and sand fifty feet to his right told
him to get ready; and then a bowlder south of the sand-puff
said <i>spat</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnny lowered his rear sight and cuddled the stock
of the heavy Sharp's to his cheek. Slowly a red dot
moved up in front of his sights and he again squeezed
the trigger, and again missed. But he had no way
of knowing that Art Fleming was spitting sand and
that his eyes had not escaped the little shower.</p>

<p>"I got to guess too much," swore Johnny. "That
front sight hides him. I wonder how many times I
was goin' to file it sharp?"</p>

<p>As he reloaded, his sombrero suddenly tugged at
his scalp and a flat report sounded behind him. He
quickly rolled into a shallow depression and another
bullet sprayed him with sand.</p>

<p>"Repeater," he growled. "I got as much sense as
a sheep-herder!"</p>

<p>There now was plenty of cover between him and
Repeater, but there was still too little distance between
him and Fleming; and the latter was a disconcertingly
good shot. Two quick reports sounded from the
house and Johnny smiled; the man at the door was
seeing things, and backing his imagination with lead.</p>

<p>Johnny was watching a ridge behind him. "Me an'
Repeater are goin' to argue," he remarked, and almost
fired when a sombrero slowly arose on the skyline.</p>

<p>"Cussed near bit," he chuckled; "but you got to
have yore head in that bonnet before I lets drive."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>A matted tuft of grass on the top of the ridge moved
so gently that only a very observant eye would have
detected it. Johnny's Sharp's roared, and instantly was
answered from a point a yard away from the stirring
clump of grass, the bullet fanning his face.</p>

<p>"Yo're too cussed tricky," grunted Johnny; "but I
got a few of my own."</p>

<p>Leaving his rifle lying so that its barrel barely projected
into sight, he slipped into a gulley and crept
toward the west, a Colt in his hand.</p>

<p>Repeater again stirred the grass tuft, and then he
found a rock about the size of a man's head and pushed
it up to the skyline of the ridge. Nothing happened.
"If my hair wasn't so red," he murmured, "I'd take
a peek. It's an awful cross for a man to bear."</p>

<p>He was a cheerful cattle-thief and did not get easily
discouraged. Also, he was something of a genius, as
he proved by putting his sombrero on the rock and
raising the decoy high enough in the grass for the
hat brim to show.</p>

<p>"Shoot, cuss you!" he grunted, leveling his rifle;
and then as the uneventful seconds passed he grew
fault-finding and used bad language. Suddenly a suspicion
flashed across his mind.</p>

<p>"That would fool a man with second sight," he
muttered. "Somethin's plumb wrong; an' I think
I better move. That bowlder over there looks good."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
And as he crawled behind it a pair of keen eyes barely
caught sight of his disappearing heel.</p>

<p>"That man's got th' right to wear expensive hats,"
grinned Johnny, squatting behind a great mass of lava;
and his grin widened as he glimpsed the sombrero-topped
rock. "Yes, sir: he's got a head worth 'em;
an' if I don't watch him close I'll grab holt of th'
wrong end of somethin'."</p>

<p>Across the valley Fleming, having cleared his eyes
of sand, was rapidly recovering his normal vision and
was preparing with cheerful optimism to bombard
everything which looked capable of sheltering his
enemy, when a movement north of and far behind
the suspected area acted upon him galvanically. He
threw the rifle to his shoulder without elevating the
sight, raised it instinctively to the angle of maximum
range and squeezed the trigger. He did not expect
a hit, and he did not get one; but he caused his friendship
to be strongly doubted.</p>

<p>Repeater ducked, and when his face bobbed up again
it wore an expression of outraged trust, and he raised
a belligerent fist and muttered profanely in hot censure
of the distant experimenter. Fleming, chuckling
at his friend Sanford's anxiety, raised his sombrero
and waved it, seeming to regard this as ample reparation.</p>

<p>"He's gettin' as bad as Gates," growled Sanford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
eying a leaden splotch on a bowlder a foot above his
head; "but he can shoot like th' hinges of h&mdash;l with
that blasted Sharp's."</p>

<p>He suddenly leaped closer to the bowlder and behind
its sheltering bulge, for Fleming, having apologized,
fired again. The marksman was frantically
waving his sombrero, seemingly indicating a southerly
direction.</p>

<p>Sanford scowled at him. "Does he want me to
go south, or does he mean that that feller is south of
me?"</p>

<p>Fleming, with no regard for the cost of Sharp's
Specials, fired again and Sanford heard the slobbering,
wheezing hum of a nearly spent bullet turning end
over end in the air and trying to ricochet after it
struck.</p>

<p>"He's shootin' south of me," said Sanford; "an' I
stays here. Somethin' tells me that th' feller that does
th' movin' is goin' to die. No red-head ever made
a handsome corpse, an' bein' th' red-head which I
mentions, I'm goin' to stick to this hunk of granite
like a tick to a cow."</p>

<p>Johnny, hands on hips, was glaring defiance at the
cheerful spendthrift, sorry that he had left his rifle
behind. He regarded Fleming as a meddlesome busybody
who took delight in revealing his every movement.
Also, the optimist was a good shot; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
derived no satisfaction from the fact that the closest
bullet had been a ricochet, for a key-holing slug makes
an awful mess if it lands.</p>

<p>"I'll bust yore neck!" quoth Johnny, shaking a fist
at the persistent nuisance; and then he jumped aside
as a sudden sharp <i>spat!</i> came from the bowlder. "You
can shoot near as good as Red Connors; but if he was
here he'd show you what that little difference means."
He raised his voice: "Hey, Repeater! Who is that
fool?"</p>

<p>Sanford laughed softly and made no answer; but
he carelessly showed a shirt sleeve, and when he jerked
it back under cover it needed a patch.</p>

<p>"What th' h&mdash;l you doin'?" demanded Sanford
heatedly.</p>

<p>"Who's Red Shirt?"</p>

<p>"Ackerman."</p>

<p>"Then he's better with a Sharp's than a Colt."</p>

<p>"That's a Spencer carbine."</p>

<p>Johnny laughed derisively: "If it is he'll strain it."</p>

<p>"It's a Winchester," chuckled Sanford.</p>

<p>"Yo're a liar!"</p>

<p>"Yo're another! She's a single-shot, .40-90."</p>

<p>"Then he's changed guns. He had a Winchester
repeater in Hastings. I saw it."</p>

<p>"You'll see too much some day. You'll see a slug
in yore eye."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm waitin'," replied Johnny, and ducked. Fleming
was getting good again, and Johnny was glad that
he could not see where his bullets were landing, for as
it was he was shooting by guess.</p>

<p>"He'll get you yet," encouraged Sanford.</p>

<p>"Think I'm goin' to wait for it?" indignantly demanded
Johnny.</p>

<p>"Gimme a look at you," urged Sanford genially.</p>

<p>"Stand up an' take it," retorted Johnny.</p>

<p>"Reckon I'm scared to?"</p>

<p>There was no reply, for Johnny had slipped away
and was running at top speed along a gully, where he
was out of sight of the hard-working Fleming. A few
minutes later he had reached his rifle and was cuddling
it against his cheek; and he was causing Sanford
a great amount of mental anguish and wriggling
progress.</p>

<p>"Some people calls this strategy," muttered Johnny,
"but I calls it common sense."</p>

<p>Raising his head cautiously he looked across the
valley but saw no sign of Fleming; and he figured that
it would be an hour before that interesting person could
cross the valley and get close enough to be a menace.
What concerned him most were the two rustlers'
friends, who must certainly have heard the shooting.
Out of deference to the curiosity of those individuals
he crawled into a partly filled-in crevice, whose sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
were steep rock and whose floor was several feet below
the level of the surrounding plateau.</p>

<p>Peering out from between two rocks he saw Sanford's
sombrero disappear from the ridge, and then it
cautiously arose again; and Johnny's eyes narrowed,
for he knew the numerous uses of sombreros.</p>

<p>"Keep stickin' it up," he muttered. "An when I
get tired shootin' at it you'll stick yore head in it an'
get a good look around. Most generally when a man
pokes up an empty hat th' crown don't tip back as it
rises; it just comes up level. An honest hat slants back
more an' more as it comes up. 'Cause why? Why,
'cause. 'Cause a man uses his neck to raise his head
with. Now, if he kept his neck stiff an' raised his
whole body, from th' knees up, plumb straight in th'
air, then th' hat would come up level. An' I asks you,
Ladies an' Gents, if a man layin' down behind a little
ridge can raise his whole body stiff an' straight,
plumb up an' down? No, ma'am; he can't. He raises
his soiled an' leathery neck, an' th' top of th' useful
sombrero just naturally leans backward; just like that.</p>

<p>"Look, Mister; there it comes again; an' it don't
tip back at all. I shall ignore it, deliberate an' cold.
But when it tips back, lifelike an' natural, like a' honest
hat should, then I'll pay attention to it, me an' my
little Sharp's Special.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've done made a study of appearin' hats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
I'm a reg'lar he-milliner. It was Red Connors an'
Hoppy that directed my great intelligence to that important
science. Tex Ewalt knowed about it, too. Tex
was eddicated, he was. He said it is in th' little things
that genius showed. He said somethin' about genius
payin' attention to details, an' havin' infernal patience.
Now, Ladies an' Gents, a hat is a detail; an' right now
I've got th' infernal patience. Lookee! There she
comes again! Level as a table. So, you see; I'm a
genius. An' ain't he a persistent cuss? He's got infernal
patience, too; but he ain't no genius. He ain't
strong on details."</p>

<p>He looked around and grinned. Another hat, to
the west of him, was in plain sight.</p>

<p>"Huh! Two hats in sight are two corners of a triangle;
an' sometimes th' most dangerous corner is th'
third, where there ain't no hat. Somewhere east of
me there's a feller sneakin' up; an' he's th' feller I got
to ventilate with my long-distance ventilator. An'
mebby th' second hat's boss is circlin' around bare-headed;
but it is still a triangle. Mebby it's a four
or five or six cornered triangle. An' me, I'm all alone;
so I'll crawl east an' hunt for company."</p>

<p>He dropped the monologue and took up the science
of wriggling swiftly and silently; and when he stopped
he was in the middle of a nest of rocks and bowlders
at the base of a great pile of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>The second hat still could be seen, but he gave most
of his attention to the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"If I'm wrong, why did Number Two stick up his
hat? I'll bet a peso that him, or Red Shirt, or their
friends are stalkin' me from th' east. An' I'll bet two
pesos that I'll cure him of such pranks. There's only
two ways of explainin' that second hat. One is that
th' owner is loco. Th' other is that he left his sign
hangin' up to show me where he ain't. Th' other is
that he left it so I'd think he wasn't there, but he is.
An' th' other is that he figgered I'd think he left it to
show me where he ain't an' that I'd think he was, so
he moved on an' ain't there at all. Jumpin' mavericks!
It makes my head ache. Havin' settled it with
only four ways left to guess, I'll stay pat, right here,
an' let them do th' openin'."</p>

<p>The shadows were growing longer and reaching out
from bowlders and brush like dark fingers of destiny,
and the sun hung over the western buttes and set them
afire with brilliant colors. A lizard flashed around a
rock, regarded the prone and motionless figure with
frank suspicion until a slight movement sent it scurrying
back again.</p>

<p>To the left a bush trembled slightly and he covered
a rain-worn crease which cut through the top of a
ditch bank. To the right a pebble clicked and behind
him came the faint snapping of a twig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Three</i> of 'em stalkin' me!" he muttered angrily.
"I got to shoot on sight an' not waste a shot. An'
they knowed where I was, judgin' from th' way they're
closin' in on that crevice."</p>

<p>In front of him a red line showed and, rising steadily
into view, became the back of a bare head. Then,
very slowly, a brown neck pushed up, followed by the
shoulders. Johnny picked up a small rock and arose
to a squatting position.</p>

<p>Sanford was now on his toes, crouching, the tips of
his left hand fingers on the ground, while in his other
hand, held shoulder high, poised a Colt, ready for that
quick, chopping motion which many men affected.</p>

<p>Johnny took careful aim and threw the stone. Sanford
jumped when the missile struck near him, and
wheeled like a flash, the Colt swinging down. He saw
a squatting figure, a dull glint of metal and a spurt of
flame. Johnny wriggled swiftly back among the rocks
and awaited developments.</p>

<p>"They don't know who fired," he mused, "an' they
dassn't ask."</p>

<p>If it had been a miss the silence would have been unbroken,
as before, until a second shot shattered it; and
if it had killed the rustler the silence also would remain
unbroken; but if Sanford had scored a kill he instantly
would have made it known. Being uncertain they were
sure to investigate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cuss it, there's at least two left; an' there may be
four or five," grumbled Johnny. "I stay right here till
dark."</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a soft, rubbing sound, and he
guessed that someone wearing leather chaps was crawling
along the rocky ground behind the pile of bowlders
which sheltered him. The sound grew softer and died
out, and a panic-stricken lizard flitted around a rock,
stopped instantly as it caught sight of him, wheeled
and darted between two stones. Johnny smiled grimly
and waited, the gun poised in his hand. Again the rubbing
sounded, this time a little nearer, and he softly
pushed himself further back among the bowlders.
Something struck his left hand holster and he glanced
quickly backward, and paled suddenly as he saw the
copperhead wrestling to get its fangs loose. He drew
in his breath sharply and his hand darted back and
down, gripping behind the vicious, triangular, burnished
head; and instantly a three-foot, golden-brown,
blotched band writhed around his wrist and arm, seeming
to flow beneath its skin. Jerking his hand forward
again he broke the reptile's neck, tore it from his arm,
shoved it back among the rocks, picked up the Colt
again, and waited.</p>

<p>There sounded, clear and sharp, a sudden whirring
rattle and the rubbing sound grew instantly louder.
Again the fear-inspiring warning sounded and he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
pebbles rolling, where a creeping rustler made frantic
efforts to get back where he suddenly felt that he
belonged. A rattlesnake ready for war is not a pleasant
thing to crawl onto.</p>

<p>"This is a devil of a place!" muttered Johnny, cold
chills running along his spine. "It's a reg'lar den!
As soon as that cow-thief gets far enough away, that
rattler will slip in among these rocks&mdash;an' my laigs
ain't goin' to be back there when he arrives!"</p>

<p>He wriggled softly out of the narrow opening and
found more comfort on a wider patch of ground, where
he could sit on his feet. As he settled back he saw the
rattler slipping among the stones at his left.</p>

<p>"It all belongs to you an' yore friends," muttered
Johnny, getting off his feet. "I'll risk th' bullets,
cussed if I won't!" And he forthwith crawled toward
the side where he had heard the rubbing sounds.</p>

<p>The shadows were gone, merged into the dusk
which was rapidly settling over the plateau, and he had
to wait only a little longer to be covered by darkness;
but he preferred to do his waiting at a point distant
from a snakes' den. Creeping along the edge of the
bowlder pile, alert both for snakes and rustlers, he at
last reached the southern end and stopped suddenly.
A leather-covered leg was disappearing around a dense
thicket, and he darted to the shelter of a gully to wait
until darkness would hide him on his return to camp.</p>

<h2 id="XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
TREED</h2></div>


<p>Johnny awakened at the shot and softly rolled
out of his blanket. The fire was nearly out, but
an occasional burst of flame from the end of the last
stick served to show him the outlines of the little tent
and the glistening hobnails in the soles of the protruding
boots. A bush stirred and a careless step snapped
a twig with a report startlingly loud in the night. A
voice some distance behind him called out to a figure
which appeared like a ghost upon the edge of the little
clearing.</p>

<p>"Get him, Purdy?"</p>

<p>Boots scraped on stone at his right and another
voice raised out of the dark. "If he didn't, there'd
be some cussed rapid shootin' about now!"</p>

<p>"Course I got him!" snorted Purdy.</p>

<p>Johnny cautiously backed out of the thicket while
the men behind him crashed through the brush and
swore at the density of the growth.</p>

<p>The man at the end of the clearing stopped and stood
quietly regarding the vague boots, his rifle at the ready.
Somehow he did not feel that everything was as it
should be. The boots appeared to be in the same posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>tion
as when he had espied them a moment before. He
must have made a lucky brain or heart shot, or&mdash;. He
raised his hand swiftly and backed into the oak brush
again, where Mexican locust in the high grass stabbed
him mercilessly. Again his rifle spoke. The boots
did not move.</p>

<p>"You got him th' first time," laughed Fleming, walking
rapidly toward the tent; but he was not confident
enough in his claim to put up his Colt.</p>

<p>"Shore," endorsed Holbrook. "It was good judgment,
an' good luck."</p>

<p>Fleming, Colt ready, leaned swiftly over, grasped a
boot and gave a strong pull&mdash;and went down on his
back, the Colt exploding and flying one way while the
boot, showering pebbles and small bits of rock, soared
aloft and went the other way.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n him!" swore Purdy, diving back into the
brush and giving no thought to the thorns. "Cover,
fellers! Quick!" he cried.</p>

<p>His warning was hardly needed, for Holbrook had
dived headfirst into a matted thicket and landed on
some locust with but little more that passing knowledge
of its presence. Fleming bounded to his feet, scooped
up his Colt on the run and jumped into another thicket,
unmindful at first of the peculiar odor which assailed
his nostrils. He had no time, then, to think about
skunks, or whether or not they were hydrophobic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The silence was deep and unbroken, except for an
occasional faint swish or scrape, for three men had settled
down where they had landed, there to remain
until daylight, not far off, came to help them.</p>

<p>Out of the clearing a small, striped animal moved
leisurely and defiantly, tainting the air, and entered the
tent. It instantly became the cynosure of three pairs of
anxious eyes, for while August was a long way off,
three worried punchers found small satisfaction in that.
They would sooner face an angry silver-tip, or a cougar
with young, than to intrude upon the vision of that
insignificant but odorous "'phoby cat." Each of them
knew of instances, related by others, where men bitten
by a skunk had gone raving mad; but none of them,
personally, ever had seen any such case; and none of
them had any intention of letting the other two see any
such a shocking spectacle in the immediate future.</p>

<p>The little animal emerged from the tent and appeared
to be undecided as to which way to go; and no
roulette ball ever possessed the fascination nor furnished
the thrills that took hold of the three staring
watchers. It took a few steps one way and a few
steps the other, and then started straight for the thicket
where Art Fleming shuddered and swore under his
breath. Two sighs arose on the air concurrent with the
cursing.</p>

<p>"Just my cussed luck!" gritted Fleming. "Get out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of here, cuss you!" he whispered fiercely, and raised
his Colt. No sane man, with his firm beliefs regarding
skunks, would hesitate when forced to choose between
probable death from a bullet or certain and horrible
death from hydrophobia. The skunk reached the edge
of the thicket, five feet from the perspiring puncher,
and was blown into a mass of reeking flesh.</p>

<p>Fleming groaned miserably. "They shore dies
game!" he swore, half-nauseated. "They're cussed
strong finishers! Why couldn't he 'a' headed for one
of th' others? I got to move, right now."</p>

<p>He did so, slowly, cautiously, painfully; but the scent
moved with him. He stopped, mopped his face, and
then held his hand away from him. His sleeve, vest,
and sombrero proclaimed their presence with an enthusiastic
strength and persistence.</p>

<p>"Cussed if he didn't <i>hit</i> me! An' I might just as
well go back to th' ranch, so far's huntin' Nelson is concerned.
He could smell me a day before he caught
sight of me!" A sickly grin slipped over his face, for
he was blessed with a keen sense of humor. "Won't
Gates an' Quigley be indignant when I odors in upon
'em!"</p>

<p>Purdy rolled his head in silent mirth, one hand over
his nose; and Holbrook alternately chuckled and
swore, wishing that the soft wind would shift and spare
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Laugh!" blazed Fleming, angry, ashamed, and
disgusted, removing his vest and throwing it into the
clearing. His sombrero followed it and then there was
a ripping sound and a red flannel shirt sleeve joined the
other cast-offs. The little, persistent flame on the
stick blazed higher and revealed the collection of personal
effects.</p>

<p>"If he peels off th' rest of his shirt an' shucks his
pants, he'll smell near as bad," chuckled Purdy gleefully.</p>

<p>"Dan'l Boone Number Two!" said Holbrook, tears
in his eyes. "But I shore wish he had enticed it off
aways before he shot it!"</p>

<p>Dawn stole from the east and the magnificent sunrise
passed unnoticed. Fleming, sullen, angry, odorous,
trudged doggedly to his horse, which regarded him
with evil eyes, mounted and rode away at a gallop in
his desire to create a breeze; and in this the horse
needed no urging. Back in the canyon Purdy and Holbrook
scouted diligently, but with caution, covering
ground slowly and thoroughly as they advanced.</p>

<p>Under a tangled thicket near the camp there was a
sudden movement, and Johnny, hands and face covered
with blood from the scratches of thorns, slowly
emerged and followed the scouting rustlers at a distance.
Satisfied that they would not return he circled
swiftly to the south of the camp and caught a glimpse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of Fleming as that unfortunate plodded dejectedly over
a distant ridge on his way to his horse.</p>

<p>Johnny watched for a moment, and then, turning
hastily, slipped back to the camp, where he collected
what he could carry, packed it into blankets, put on the
well-worn, heavy boots, fastened the pack on his back
and dashed into the cover again, desperately anxious
to gain his objective.</p>

<p>He knew what would happen. As soon as Fleming
reached the ranch-houses he would reclothe himself
and return with those of his friends who were able to
accompany him; and it would not be long before the
Twin Buttes section would be thoroughly combed. He
could not hide his trail, so it were wise to lead them to
a place they could not search.</p>

<p>Slipping on the treacherous malpais and loose stones,
fighting through the torturing locust and cactus hidden
in the grass, he pushed through matted thickets of oak
brush and manzanito by main strength, savagely determined
to gain his goal well in advance of the creeping,
cautious cattle-thieves who crept, foot by foot, down
the canyon on the other side of the butte.</p>

<p>A black bear lumbered out of his way and sat down
to watch him pass, the little eyes curious and unblinking.
Several white-tailed deer shot up a slope ahead of
him in unbelievable leaps and at a remarkable speed.
He leaped over a fallen pine trunk and his heavy boot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>heel
crushed a snake which rattled and struck at the
same instant; but the heavy boots and the trousers
tucked within them made the vicious fangs harmless.
Flies swarmed about him and yellow-jackets stung him
as he squashed over a muddy patch of clay. A grinning
coyote slunk aside to give him undisputed right-of-way,
while high up on the slope a silver-tip grizzly stopped
his foraging long enough to watch him pass.</p>

<p>For noise he cared nothing; the up-flung butte reared
its rocky walls between him and his enemies; and he
plunged on, all his energies centered on speed, regardless
of the stings and the sweat which streamed down
him, tinged with blood from the mass of smarting
scratches. Malpais, cunningly hidden in the grass,
pressed painfully against the worn, thin soles of his
boots and hurt him cruelly as he slipped and floundered.
He staggered and slipped more frequently now, and
the pack on his back seemed to have trebled in weight;
his breath came in great, sobbing gulps and the blood
pulsed through his aching temples like hammer blows,
while a hot, tight band seemed to encircle his parched
throat; but he now was in sight of his goal.</p>

<p>Beginning at a rock slide, a mass of treacherous
broken rock and shale in which he sank to his ankles
at every plunging step, a faint zigzag line wandered up
the southern face of the butte. He did not know that
it could be mastered, but he did not have time to gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the easier trail, up which he had led his horse. Struggling
up the shale slope, slipping and floundering in the
treacherous footing, he flung himself on the rock ledge
which slanted sharply upward.</p>

<p>Resting until his head cleared, he began a climb
which ever after existed in his memory as a vague but
horrible nightmare. Rattlesnakes basked in the
sun, coiling swiftly and sounding their whirring alarm
as he neared them; but blindly thrown rocks mashed
them and sent them writhing over the edge to whirl
to destruction in the valley below. Treacherous, rotten
ledges crumbled as he put his weight on them, and
he saved himself time and time again only by an intuitive
leap nearly as dangerous as the peril he avoided.
At many places the ledge disappeared, and it was only
by desperate use of fingers and toes that he managed to
pass the gaps, spread-eagled against the cliff while he
moved an inch at a time, high above the yawning
depths, to the beginning of a new ledge.</p>

<p>Scrawny, hardy shrubs, living precariously in cracks
and on ledges, and twisted roots found his grip upon
them. At one place a flue-like crack in the wall, a
"chimney," was the only way to proceed, and he
climbed it, back and head against one side, knees and
hands against the other, the strain making him faint
and dizzy. Below him lay the tree-tops, dwarfed, a
blur to his throbbing eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>A ledge of rock upon which he momentarily rested
his weight detached itself and plunged downward a
sheer three hundred feet, crashing through the underbrush
and scrub timber before it burst apart. On hands
and knees he crossed a muddy spot, where a thin
trickle of water, no wider than his thumb, spread out
and made the ledge slippery before it was sucked in
by the sun-baked rocks. A swarm of yellow-jackets, balancing
daintily on the wet rock, attacked him viciously
when he disturbed them. He struck at them blindly,
instinctively shielding his eyes, and arose to his feet as
he groped onward.</p>

<p>The pack on his back, aside from its weight, was a
thing of danger, for several times it thrust against the
wall and lost him his balance, threatening him with instant
destruction; but each time he managed to save
himself by a frantic twist and plunge to his hands and
knees, clawing at the precarious footing with fingers
and toes.</p>

<p>At one place he lay prostrate for several minutes
before his will, shaking off the lethargy which numbed
him, sent him on again. And the spur which awakened
his dulled senses proved that his frantic haste was justified;
for a sharp, venomous whine overhead was followed
by the flat impact of lead on rock, and a handful
of shale and small bits of stone showered down upon
him. The faint, whip-like report in the valley did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
penetrate his roaring ears, for now all he could think
of was the edge of the butte fifty feet above him.</p>

<p>Never had such a distance seemed so great, so impossible
to master. It seemed as though ages passed
before he clawed at the rim and flung himself over it
in one great, despairing effort and fell, face down and
sprawling, upon the carpet of grass and flowers. Down
in the valley the persistent reports ceased, but he did
not know it; and an hour passed before he sat up and
looked around, dazed and faint. Arising, he staggered
to the pool where Pepper waited for him at the end of
her taut picket rope.</p>

<p>The water was bitter from concentration, but it
tasted sweeter to him than anything he ever had drunk.
He dashed it over his face, unmindful of the increased
smarting of the stings and scratches. Resting a few
minutes, he went to the top of the easier trail, up
which he had led the horse, and saw a man creeping
along it near the bottom; but the rustler fled for shelter
when Johnny's Sharp's suggested that the trail led to
sudden death.</p>

<p>Having served the notice he lay quietly resting and
watching. The heat of the canyon was gone and he
reveled in the crisp coolness of the breeze which fanned
him. As he rested he considered the situation, and
found it good. He was certain that no man would be
fool enough to attempt the way he had come while an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
enemy occupied the top of the butte; the trail up the
north side could easily be defended; the other Twin,
easy rifle range away, was lower than the one he occupied
and would not be much of a menace if he were
careful; he had water in plenty, food and ammunition
for two weeks, and there was plenty of water and grass
for the horse.</p>

<p>Safe as the butte was, he cheerfully damned the necessity
which had driven him out of the canyon: the
question of sleep. Dodging and outwitting four men
during his waking hours would not have been an impossible
task; but it only would have been a matter of
time before they would have caught him asleep and
helpless.</p>

<p>Returning to the pool, he saw how closely Pepper
had cropped the grass within the radius of the picket
rope, changed the stake and then built a fire, worrying
about the scarcity of fuel. Since he could not afford
to waste the wood he cooked a three-days supply of
food.</p>

<p>Eating a hearty meal, he made mud-plasters and applied
them to the swollen stings, binding them in place
by strips torn from an undershirt, and then he sought
the shade of the ledge by the pool for a short sleep,
which he would have to snatch at odd times during the
day so as to be awake all night, which would be the
time of greatest danger.</p>

<h2 id="XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
AT BAY</h2></div>


<p>It was late in the afternoon when he awakened
from a sleep which had been sound despite the
stings. Removing the plasters he made a tour of the
plateau, satisfying himself that there was really only
one way up and that the rustlers were not trying to get
to him. Returning to the camp, he filled a hollow in the
rock floor with water, bathed, put on his other change
of clothes, and then made a supper of cold beans and
bacon. Filling another hollow, he pushed his soiled
clothes in it to soak over night.</p>

<p>When he passed a break in the rampart-like wall
near the top of the trail, which at that point shot up
several feet above the top of the butte, a bullet
screamed past his head, so close that he felt the wind of
it. Peering cautiously across the canyon he saw a thin
cloud of smoke lazily rising over the top of a huge,
black lava bowlder on the crest of the other butte. A
head was just disappearing and he jerked his rifle to his
shoulder and fired.</p>

<p>"Five hundred an' a little more," he muttered. "I
got it now, you wall-eyed thief!"</p>

<p>Another puff of smoke burst out from the lower edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the lava bowlder, the bullet striking the rampart
below him. His reply was instantaneous, and was directed
at a light spot which ducked instantly out of
sight, just a little too quickly to be hit by the bullet,
which tossed a fine spray of dust into the air and put a
leaden streak where the face had been. He fired again,
this time at the other side of the bowlder, where he
thought he saw another moving white spot, and he
thought right.</p>

<p>After a quick glance down the trail, Johnny took a
position a hundred yards to the left, trying to find a
place where he could catch a glimpse of the hostile
marksman. But Fleming had a torn and bloody ear
and a great respect for the man on the southern Twin,
and henceforth became wedded to caution. Curiosity
was all very well, but his was thoroughly satisfied, and
discretion meant a longer life of sinful activities.</p>

<p>"I had my look, three of 'em," growled Fleming.
"An' three looks are enough for any man," he added
quizzically, binding up his bloody ear with a soiled
and faded neckerchief, which should have given him
blood-poisoning, but did not.</p>

<p>"Now that we got him treed, there ain't no use goin'
on th' rampage an' gettin' all shot up tryin' to get him.
All we got to do is wait, an' get him when he has to
come down. It'll be plumb easy when he makes his
break. A man like him is too cussed handy with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
gun for anybody to go an' get reckless with. If we
keep one man near th' bottom of that trail, he's our
meat. I don't know how he ever got up that scratch
on th' wall; but I'll bet there ain't a man livin' that can
go <i>down</i> it."</p>

<p>Johnny grew tired of watching for Fleming, and
wriggling back to where he could safely get on his feet
he arose and made the rounds again. When he reached
the place where he had floundered over the edge to
safety he critically examined the faint trail from cover,
and the more he saw of it the more he regarded his
ascent as a miracle.</p>

<p>"Only a fool would 'a' tried it," he grinned. "It's
somethin' a man can do once in a hundred times; only
he's got to make it th' very first time, or th' other
ninety-nine will shore be lost. I'll never forget it, not
never."</p>

<p>Watching a while, he wondered if it were guarded,
and grinned at the foolishness of the idea; but he
slowly pushed his sombrero out around a rock to find
out. An angry <i>spang!</i> and a wailing in the sky told
him the answer. The flat report in the valley became a
mutter along the distant hills.</p>

<p>"Good shootin'," he grunted. "Glad you was out
of breath, or excited, or somethin' this mornin'."</p>

<p>Back at the top of the other trail he found two large
rocks lying close together near the edge, and he crawled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
behind them and peered out through the narrow opening
for a closer look at the canyon.</p>

<p>It was a chaos, dotted with bowlders of granite,
sandstone, and lava, some of them as large as small
houses, their tops on a level with the tops of the nearest
trees. It was cut by rock ridges, great backbones
of stone that defied Time; and dotted with heavily
wooded draws which extended up to the foot of the
great pile of detritus embracing the foot of the buttes.
Down its lowest levels ran a zigzag streak of bright,
clean rock, the water-swept path of the torrents sent
roaring down by melting snows and an occasional
cloud-burst. Several pools, fed by a dark trickle of
water from the springs back in the upper reaches, could
be seen. Of timber there was plenty, heavy growths of
pine extending from the edge of the creek bed to the
edge of the detritus, with here and there an opening
made by the avalanches which had cut into the greenery
for short distances. At other places even the stubborn
pines could not find a grip, and a thinning out of the
growth let him see the rocky skeleton below; but these
were so few that he easily memorized their positions.
Trouble would come a-winging to any careless rustler
who blundered out onto any of them.</p>

<p>The opposite butte took his attention and he marveled
at it. Under its lava cap and the great layer
of the limestones was a greater layer of clay and shale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and the softer sandstones. These had been harassed
and battered by the winds and rains and frosts of ages
and the resulting erosion had chiseled out wonderful
bits of natural sculpturing. At one place he could see,
and with no very great strain upon his imagination, part
of a massive building with its great buttresses, where a
harder, more enduring streak of rock had offered
greater resistance to the everlasting assaults.</p>

<p>Farther to the right was a wonderful collection of
columns and pinnacles, and some of the openings between
them ran back until shrouded in darkness; great
caverns in which houses could be built.</p>

<p>As the sun sank lower the shadow effect was beautiful,
and even Johnny's practical mind was impressed
by it. The color effect he had seen before&mdash;the
streaks of black, gray, red, green, maroon, and white.
Bits of crystal and quartz were set afire by the sun's
slanting rays and some of them almost dazzled him.</p>

<p>To the west the sky was a blaze of color and the
lengthening shadows made an ever-changing picture.
Below him the dusk was beginning to shroud the bottom
of the canyon, creeping higher and higher as the
minutes passed. To see better, he wriggled closer to
the edge, and a venomous whine passed over his head
to die out swiftly in the air.</p>

<p>"Huh!" he grunted. "Fine target I must 'a' been
for that thief down there, with such a sky behind me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
I've got to remember things up here, or I'll lose my
rememberer. I'm on a skyline that <i>is</i> a skyline. An'
I ain't goin' to answer every fool that cuts loose at me,
neither. I got plenty of cartridges, but I won't have if
I start gettin' foolish with 'em. An' before dark I'm
goin' to rustle me a blanket; it's gettin' cooler by
jumps."</p>

<p>He made another visit to the south side of the butte
for a glance down the trail of misery, and then dismissed
it from his mind. In view of his experiences
with it in daylight, he knew that no human being could
climb it in the dark.</p>

<p>"It's as safe, day <i>an'</i> night, as if Red or Hoppy was
layin' right here&mdash;an' that's plenty good enough for
me," he smiled. "William, Junior's, bobcat kitten
won't never grow big enough to climb that place&mdash;an'
it's th' only thing on earth that he can't climb, blast
him!"</p>

<p>Returning to his camp he had a drink and a smoke,
and then, taking up a blanket and a pan of cold beans,
he went to the head of the trail, there to keep a long
and wearisome vigil.</p>

<p>Darkness had descended when he reached his chosen
spot, and wrapping the blanket around him he sat
down cross-legged, laid his rifle near him, and leaned
back against a rock to watch the trail and wait for daylight.
Faint, long-drawn, quavering, came the howl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
a wolf, and from a point below him in the blackness
of the canyon a cougar screamed defiance. He was
surprised by the clearness with which occasional sounds
came up to him, for he distinctly heard the crack of
dead wood where some careless foot trod, and he heard
a voice ask who had the second shift on the south side
of the butte.</p>

<p>"Turn in," came the answer. "We ain't watchin'
that side no more. You relieve me at midnight, an'
don't forget it!"</p>

<p>For some time he had been hearing strange, dragging
sounds which seemed to come from the foot of
the trail; and had been fooled into believing that an
attack was under way. Then several low crashes gave
him the distance, and he again leaned back against the
rock, slipping the Colt into its holster.</p>

<p>A tiny point of light sprang up in the darkness,
whisked behind a bowlder as he reached for his rifle,
and grew rapidly brighter. Then it soared into the air
and curved toward the foot of the trail, and almost
instantly became a great, leaping flame which soon lit
up the trail, the towering walls of the buttes, and the
glistening bowlders in the canyon.</p>

<p>He stared at it and then laughed. "They ain't satisfied
with watchin' th' trail an' listenin' with both ears,
but they has to light it up! There ain't no danger whatever
of me tryin' to get down now; an' I'd like to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
anybody try to get up it while that fire's burnin'!
They're shore kind to me."</p>

<p>"You be careful an' keep it out of th' brush," warned
a faint voice. "If she catches, this canyon will be a
little piece of h&mdash;l. Everythln's so dry it rustles."</p>

<p>"Ain't you turned in yet?" demanded the guard.
"You never mind about th' fire. You get to sleep; an'
you get awake again at twelve."</p>

<p>"Huh!" came the laughing retort. "We can <i>all</i>
go to sleep while <i>that's</i> blazin'. Go gnaw yore bone
an' quit growlin'."</p>

<p>Johnny laughed loudly, derisively. "I may set it on
fire myself!" he jeered. "An' if I don't, th' rainy season
is purty near due&mdash;an' when it comes you'll need
a boat. Fine lot of man-hunters you are. All you can
shoot is boots an' skunks!"</p>

<p>A flash split the darkness, and the canyon tossed the
report from side to side as though loath to let it die.
When the reverberations softened to a rolling mutter
he jeered the marksman and called him impolite names.
The angry retort was quite as discourteous and pleased
him greatly.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and then Johnny arose and crept
softly down the trail, hugging the rock wall closely.
When he reached a small pile of broken branches,
caught in a fissure, he gathered an armful and carried
them up on the butte. Firewood was too scarce for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to neglect any opportunities. A second trip enabled
him to find a few scattered pieces and they were added
to his store. Then he went to his horse, removed the
picket rope, and going to the edge of the cliff at a spot
over the trail he tied one end of the rope around a rock
and lowered the rest of it over the rim. Another trip
down the trail was necessary to make the free end fast
to a dead fir that lay along the wall, and having tied it
securely he slipped back to the plateau, hurried to
the rope and pulled on it in vain. Try as he might he
could raise only one end of the log.</p>

<p>"Cuss it!" he grunted; then he grinned and whistled
a clear note. A few minutes passed and soft hoof-beats
came slowly nearer. Then a black bulk loomed
up beside him and nuzzled his neck. "I forgot th'
saddle," he said. "You wait here, Dearly Beloved,"
and he slipped away, the horse following him.</p>

<p>They returned together and Johnny made the line
fast to the pommel of the saddle, took hold of it himself
to show his good will, and spoke to the horse.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't know nothin' about haulin', huh?"
he grunted, dropping the rope and taking the reins.
"Come on, now&mdash;easy does it. Easy! Easy! Keep it
there&mdash;th' cussed thing's got stuck on th' edge." In
a moment he returned. "All right! <i>Over</i> she comes."</p>

<p>The man at the foot of the trail hurled more wood
on the fire and then tried a few shots when the noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
above caught his ear. Then as the flames shot up he
grunted a profane question and stared at the animated
tree trunk which climbed sheer cliffs in the dark.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm cussed!" he grumbled. "Firewood!
An' me lettin' him get down there to tie that rope!"</p>

<p>Johnny peered over the rim and noticed that the
flashes came from one place, and getting his rifle he
kicked a few rocks over and fired instantly at the answering
flash. Two guns in the canyon awakened the
echoes and he stepped back to let the whining lead pass
over his head.</p>

<p>"There I go!" he snorted. "Wastin' cartridges
already! But I wish&mdash;gosh! <i>I</i> got it!"</p>

<p>Grinning with elation he felt his way along the butte
until he was directly over the fire, where he stopped and
began to search for rocks and stones, and he did not
cease until he had quite a pile of them. Approaching
the rim he peered over cautiously and searched the canyon
within the radius of the firelight, but without avail.
He noticed, however, that there seemed to be a nest
of rocks and bowlders on the outer edge of the circle
of illumination and he surmised that it was there the
guards were lying. He heaved a big stone and watched
it whiz through the lighted arc. It fell short and he
tried again. The second rock struck solidly and made
quite a noise, and choice bits of profane inquiry floated
up to him. Several more rocks evoked a sudden scram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>bling
and more profanity, and a lurid bayonet of fire
flashed from a dark spot.</p>

<p>"Now he's took to heavin' rocks!" growled a
peeved, angry voice. "D&mdash;d if he ain't th' meanest
cuss I ever saw!"</p>

<p>Johnny threw a few more missiles and a deep curse
replied from the pit. Close to the edge of the wall
was a large rock, nicely balanced. It was the size of a
small trunk, and a grin crept across his face as he
walked over to it. Putting his shoulder, all his wiry
strength, and plenty of grunts into the task, he started
it rocking more and more, and, catching it at the right
instant, he pushed it over and rolled it to the edge,
where it threatened to settle back and remain; but another
great effort rolled it slowly over the edge and it
disappeared as if by magic. Striking a sharp bulge in the
great wall when about half way down, it bounced out
in an arc; and when it struck the bowlder pile it was a
real success, judging from the noise it made. The canyon
roared and seemed to shudder as the crash boomed out;
and the huge missile, shattering into hundreds of fragments,
lavishly distributed itself through the brush and
among the bowlders like a volley of grape.</p>

<p>Deep curses roared from the canyon and several
flashes of flame darted out.</p>

<p>"Lay on yore stummicks, fightin' mosquitoes, an'
heavin' wood on that fire at long range, huh?" jeered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Johnny, throwing another rock. "These are better at
night than cartridges, an' they won't run out. I'll give
you some real troubles. I only wish I had a bag of
yellow-jackets to drop!"</p>

<p>Another jet of flame stabbed upward, but from a
new place, farther back; and a voice full of wrath and
pain described the man on the butte, and with a fertile
imagination.</p>

<p>"What's th' matter with <i>you</i>? An' what's all th'
hellaballo?" indignantly demanded another and more
distant voice. "How can a man sleep in such a blasted
uproar?"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" roared Purdy with heat. "Who cares
whether you sleep or not? He cut my head an' near
busted my arm with his d&mdash;d rocks! Mebby you
think they ain't makin' good time when they get down
here! Only hope he stumbles an' follers 'em!"</p>

<p>"He's a lucky fool," commented Fleming, serene in
the security of his new position. "Luckiest dog I ever
saw."</p>

<p>"Lucky!" snorted Purdy. "<i>Lucky!</i> Anybody else
would 'a' been picked clean by th' ki-yotes before now.
For a cussed fool playin' a lone hand he's doin' real
well. But we got th' buzzard where we want him!"</p>

<p>"Lone hand nothin'," grunted Fleming. "Didn't he
have that drunken Long Pete helpin' him?"</p>

<p>Purdy growled in his throat and gently rubbed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
numbed arm. "There's another. It just missed th'
fire. Say! <i>That's</i> what he's aimin' at!"</p>

<p>"Mebby he is," snorted Fleming; "but if he is he's
got a cussed bad aim. Judgin' from where they landed,
I bets he was aimin' 'em all at me. I got four bits that
says he wasn't aimin' at no fire when he thrun them
little ones. One of 'em come so close to my head that
I could hear th' white-winged angels a-singin'."</p>

<p>"'White-winged angels a-singin'!'" snorted Purdy.
"H&mdash;l of a chance <i>you</i>'ll ever have of hearin' white
angels sing. Yore spiritual ears'll hear steam a-sizzlin',
an' th' moans of th' damned; an' yore spiritual red
nose will smell sulphur till th' stars drop out."</p>

<p>"I'm backin' Purdy," said the distant voice. "They
don't let no skunk perfume get past th' Golden Gates."</p>

<p>"They won't let any of you in hell," jeered a clear
voice from above. "You'll swing between th' two
worlds like pendulums in eternity. Cow-thieves are
barred."</p>

<p>A profane duet was his answer, and he listened
closely as Holbrook's voice was heard. "Say!" he
growled, killing mosquitoes with both hands and sitting
up behind his bowlder. "Can't you hold yore pow-wow
somewhere else? Want him to heave rocks all
night? How can I sleep with all that racket goin' on?
Yo're near as bad as these singin' blood-suckers; an'
who was it that kicked me in th' ribs just now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you wouldn't sprawl out in a natural path an'
take up th' earth you wouldn't get kicked in th' ribs!"
snapped Fleming.</p>

<p>"Yo're a fine pair of doodle-bugs," sneered Holbrook,
sighing wearily as he arose. He lowered his
voice. "Here he is over this end of th' trail an' givin'
you a fine chance to sneak up an' bushwhack him; an' all
you do is dodge rocks, cuss yore fool luck, an' kick
folks in th' ribs. Don't you know an opportunity when
you see one?"</p>

<p>"Is <i>this</i> an opportunity?" mumbled Purdy sarcastically,
rubbing his arm and fighting mosquitoes.</p>

<p>"With that fire showing up everything for rods?"
softly asked Fleming with heavy irony. "Who's been
puttin' loco weed in <i>yore</i> grub?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't loco weed," growled Purdy. "It's redeye.
He drinks it like it was water."</p>

<p>"No such luck," retorted Holbrook; "not while
yo're around. It ain't no opportunity if yo're aimin'
to have a pe-rade past th' fire," he continued in a harsh
whisper; "but it shore was a good one if you had cut
down through th' canyon a couple of rods below th'
end of th' trail, an' then climbed up to it an' stuck close
to th' wall. You could 'a' been up there now, a-layin'
for him when he went back on guard. It's cussed near
as simple as you are."</p>

<p>"You must 'a' read that in that joke book what come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
with th' last bottle of liniment," derided Purdy. "Fine,
healthy target a man would make if he didn't get over
th' top in time! Lovely job! You must think he's a
fool."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sarcastic with him, Purdy," chuckled
Fleming. "He does real well for a man that thinks
with his feet."</p>

<p>"You fellers make me tired!" muttered Holbrook
in sudden decision as another rock flew into pieces on a
bowlder and rattled through the brush. "I'd just as
soon get shot on a good gamble as die from these
whinin' leeches. I'm all bumps, an' every bump itches
like blazes. I never thought there was so many of
'em on earth. You watch me go up there&mdash;an' cover
me if you can. Jeer at him an' keep him up there
heavin' rocks as long as you can."</p>

<p>"Watch you?" grunted Purdy. "That's just what
I'm aimin' to do. I'm aimin' to watch <i>you</i> do it. We
don't have to take chances like that. His grub will
run out an' make him come down. Time is no object
to us. We can afford to wait."</p>

<p>"You can't do it, Frank," said Fleming, dogmatically,
ducking low as another rock smashed itself to
pieces against a bowlder.</p>

<p>"Huh!" snorted Holbrook, picking up his rifle and
departing.</p>

<p>His friends chose their positions judiciously and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
shouted insults at the man on the butte; and after a
few minutes they saw Holbrook, bent double, dart
swiftly across a little open space, disappear into the
brush and emerge into sight again, vague and shadowy,
near the base of the wall a dozen yards below the end
of the trail. He crept slowly over a patch of detritus
which sloped up to the wall, and began his climb, which
was not as easy a task as he had believed.</p>

<p>The wall, eroded where rotting stone had crumbled
away in layers, was a series of curving bulges, each
capped by and ending in an out-thrust ledge. He forsook
his rifle on the second ledge and went slowly, doggedly
upward, but despite all his care to make no noise,
he dislodged pebbles and chunks of rotten stone and
shale which lay thick upon the rocky shelves. When
half way up he paused to search out hand and foot
holds and became suddenly enraged at the amount of
time he was consuming; and he realized, uneasily, that
he had heard no more crashing rocks. The knowledge
sent caution to the winds and drove him at top speed,
and it also robbed him of some of the jaunty assurance
which had urged him to his task. Fear of the ridicule
and the jeers of his sarcastic friends now became a more
compelling motive than the hope of success; and he
writhed and stretched, twisted, clawed, and scrambled
upward with an angry, savage determination which he
would have characterized as "bull-headed" in anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
else. Then another smashing rock revived his hopes
and made him strain with renewed strength.</p>

<p>At last his fingers gripped the crumbling sandstone
of the trail's edge and by a fine display of strength and
agility he swung himself over it and rolled swiftly
across the slanting ledge to the base of the wall, where
he arose to his feet and leaped up the precarious path.
The ascent was twelve hundred feet long and it swept
upward at a grade which defied anyone to dash along
it for any distance. Walking rapidly would have taxed
to the utmost a man in the pink of condition; and his
pedal exercise for years had been mostly confined to
walking to his horse.</p>

<p>The footing was far from satisfactory and demanded
close scrutiny in daylight, while in the dark it was a
desperate gamble except when attempted at a snail's
pace. Ridges, crevices, stones, pebbles, drifts of shale
and rotten stone, treacherous in their obedience to the
law of gravity when the pressure of a foot started
them sliding toward the edge of the abyss; places where
the soft sandstone had split in great masses and dropped
into the canyon, taking parts of the trail with them and
leaving only broken, narrow ledges of the same rotten
stone, all these conspired to make him use up precious
minutes.</p>

<p>Below him to his right lay a sheer drop of two hundred
feet; above him towered the massive wall; behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
him and unable to help him, were his friends, and the
fire, which was not bright enough to let him see the
footing, but too bright for his safety in another way;
before him stretched the heart-breaking trail, steep,
seemingly interminable, leading to the top of the butte,
where the silence was ominous, for somewhere up there
was an expert shot defending his life. He had heard
no more crashing rocks, and the insults of his friends
had not been answered; and to hear such an answer or
the crash of a rock he would have given his season's
profits.</p>

<p>He paused for breath more frequently with each
passing minute and his feet were like weights of lead,
the muscles in his legs aching and nearly unresponsive.
He was paying for the speed he had made in the beginning.</p>

<p>The great wall curved slightly outward now and he
hugged it closely as he groped onward, and soon
emerged from its shadow to become silhouetted against
the fire below. And then a spurt of flame split the
darkness above him and a shriek passed over his head
and died out below as the roar of the heavy rifle awoke
crashing echoes in the canyon.</p>

<p>Below him lurid jets of fire split the darkness and
singing lead winged through the air with venomous
whines, which arose to a high pitch as they passed him
and died out in the sky. He knew that his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
were firing well away from the wall, but he cursed them
for the mistakes they might make. Another flash
blazed above him, and the sound of the lead and the
roar of the gun told him that his enemy was now using
a Colt. Ordinarily this would have given him a certain
amount of satisfaction, for everyone knows that
while a rifle is effective at such a range, a hit with a
revolver is largely a matter of luck; but as he leaped
back into a handy recess a second bullet from the Colt
struck the generous slack of his trousers and burned a
welt on that portion of his anatomy where sitting in a
saddle would irritate the most. It was a lucky shot,
but Holbrook was too much of a pessimist at that moment
to derive any satisfaction from the knowledge.</p>

<p>"I'm in a h&mdash;l of a pickle!" he growled as the
shadows of the recess folded about him. "I can't go
up, an' I can't go down&mdash;I can't even <i>sit</i> down. I got
to wait till that fire dies out&mdash;an' suppose they don't
let it die? Five minutes more an' I would have won
out."</p>

<p>"Hey, Frank! Are you all right?" asked a voice.</p>

<p>"That's Fleming, th' fool," growled Holbrook. "I
suppose he wants me to step out on th' edge of the
platform an' speak a piece for him."</p>

<p>A laugh rang out at the head of the trail. "Answer
th' gentleman," said Johnny in a low voice, fully appreciating
Holbrook's feelings. "Don't it beat all how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
some folks allus pick th' wrong time in their yearnin'
for conversation? I've been there; more'n once. You
promise to go down an' give him a lickin' an' I won't
pull a trigger on you while yo're on th' trail!"</p>

<p>"Hey, Frank! <i>Oh</i>, Frank!" persisted Fleming.</p>

<p>"Tell him to shut up," chuckled Johnny. "Here,
I'll do it for you: Hello!" he shouted. "Hello, you
loquacious fool! Frank says for you to shut up!"</p>

<p>Fleming's retort was unkind.</p>

<p>"Frank says he ain't smelled no skunk since he left
th' canyon!" jeered Johnny. "Don't you get up-wind
of me!"</p>

<p>Fleming's retort was even more unkind.</p>

<p>"Hey!" yelled Purdy, cheerfully "You ought to
'a' heard what Quigley said when Art odored into th'
house! Dan'l Boone was scared it would get in his
wounds an' poison him to death."</p>

<p>"Yo're a sociable ki-yote!" jeered Fleming.</p>

<p>Johnny laughed. "I'm that sociable I carries callin'
cards, like you read about in th' mail-order catalogues.
They're snub-nosed an' covered with grease, which I
mostly rubs off because of th' sand stickin' to it. I'm
'most as sociable as th' dogs that drove me out of my
valley, burned my cabin, stole my cows, an' put me out
of th' game. I'm 'most as sociable as th' three skunks
that laid for me that night. I told Quigley in Pop
Hayes' saloon what I'd do if I was pestered; an' I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
been doin' it. An' I ain't through yet, neither. Here's
one of my cards now," he jeered, sending a .45 down
the trail to let Holbrook know that he was not forgotten.</p>

<p>"You stopped my play, an' stole my cows," he said.
"So I'm goin' to take all them that you got in yore
sink. When I gets through <i>I'll</i> be th' owner of th' QE
ranch, all by myself; an' there won't be none of you
left to bother me. Hoggin' a free country is a game
two can play at, an' you shore got a good pupil when
you taught me th' game. I'm aimin' to set up a record
for th' cow-country. I never heard tell of a man
shootin' off a whole outfit an' takin' their ranch; but
that's just what <i>I'm</i> goin' to do unless you fellers get
out of th' country while you can."</p>

<p>Jeering laughter and ridicule answered him; and
then Purdy had an inspiration and voiced it with unnecessary
vigor and quite a little pride.</p>

<p>"Hey, Frank!" he yelled. "If yo're all right, heave
a rock over th' edge!"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence and then a faint crash
sounded in the canyon.</p>

<p>"There," called Johnny pleasantly. "Does that satisfy
you, or shall I heave another?"</p>

<p>Fluent swearing came from below, in which Holbrook
fervently joined, <i>sotto voce</i>, and he heaved another
rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnny laughed loudly. "There's another in case
you didn't hear th' first. I'm tellin' you about it because
I don't want to deceive you. Mebby one of you
fellers would like to sneak up here an' drag yore friend
down?"</p>

<p>Holbrook reviewed the situation and could not see
that he gained anything by keeping silent.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> heaved them rocks!" he shouted savagely. "I'm
all right. Now you put out that fire an' gimme a
chance. I don't want to stay up here forever!"</p>

<p>"All right, Frank," called a new voice, which
Johnny recognized as belonging to Quigley.</p>

<p>"Shore," jeered Johnny. "Run out an' kick it apart
an' smother it with sand," he invited, reaching for his
rifle. "But you want to do a good job. An' if he's
still there at daylight you won't have to bother about
him no more. I mean business now. I gave three of
you thieves yore lives th' night you burned my cabin;
but I'm shootin' on sight now."</p>

<p>"You got too cussed much to say!" snapped Holbrook
angrily.</p>

<p>"An' I'll have more to say if yo're there at sunup,"
retorted Johnny. "An' lemme tell you, fire or no fire,
you ain't down in th' canyon yet!"</p>

<p>Holbrook laughed. "You'll be as savin' of yore
cartridges as you are of yore grub. How long do you
reckon you can hold out?" he sneered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"It only takes four bullets to clear a way for me,"
retorted Johnny.</p>

<p>New sounds came from the canyon. Rock after rock
curved into the arc of illumination and landed in the
fire, knocking it apart and sending blazing sticks flying
toward the wall of the butte. Quigley warned his men
to be careful and not set the brush on fire. There was
a sudden puff of steam and the light dimmed quickly.
Several other hatfuls of water turned the blazing
embers into a black, smoking mass, where only an occasional
red speck showed in the darkness.</p>

<p>The trail was blotted out and Johnny sent a .45
whining along it. A flash from below replied to him
and he listened for a sound which would tell him that
Holbrook had started on the return trip. But that
individual, boots in hand, made no noise as he slipped
along the wall. Coming to another recess, he sought
its shelter, tied the boots together with his neckerchief,
slung them over his shoulder and started down
again.</p>

<p>Quigley ordered his companions not to shoot. "You
might get Frank; an' he's in danger enough as it is.
Yore flash will give that coyote a fair idea of where
th' trail is."</p>

<p>"Did you hear what that ki-yote said about takin'
our ranch?" asked Purdy.</p>

<p>Quigley laughed. "Yes; an' I admire his gall. He's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
got three of us, if he got Ackerman; but we wasn't
awake to his game then." Another flash came from the
top of the butte, and he growled when he heard the
spat of the bullet. "He ain't lost th' trail yet, but he's
puttin' 'em high."</p>

<p>"He'd be a handy man to have around," said Fleming.
"I wonder if he'd 'a' throwed in with us, 'stead
of rustlin' by hisself?"</p>

<p>"I'd 'a' found that out if Ackerman hadn't 'a' been
so dead set ag'in him," grunted Quigley, not refusing
to take credit for an idea that was not his own. "I
wonder," he mused.</p>

<p>"Offer him a share," suggested Purdy. "If we
change our minds later, that's <i>our</i> business. We're
losin' a lot of time with him; too much."</p>

<p>There was a sudden rattle of shale and pebbles, low-voiced
profanity and a crash of breaking branches.
"Cuss them rotten ledges!" said a voice not far distant.
"An' d&mdash;n these cactus an' locusts! I owe him
more than he can ever square up, blast his hide!"</p>

<p>"Thank th' Lord," muttered Quigley in sudden relief.</p>

<p>"But mebby he <i>is</i> workin' for Logan," objected
Fleming. "Hey, Frank! Over here."</p>

<p>"If he is it's about time for th' CL to hunt him up,"
Purdy growled anxiously. "We'd shore be in a fix if
they caught us down here!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"CL or no CL, we stays!" snapped Holbrook,
rounding a bowlder and swearing at every step. "We
got him now; an' we ain't goin' to let him go!"</p>

<p>"Shore!" endorsed Quigley. "They drove me off
th' range; but I'll stay in these hills if I dies for it.
Once we get this feller out of th' way an' get back to
th' ranch we can put up an awful fight from th' houses,
if we're forced to. They're stocked good enough to
last us six fellers over four months. It's a show-down
for me, come what might; but any man can take his
share of th' money an' get away, if he wants."</p>

<p>Growls answered him, and he laughed. "That's
th' way! Well, Frank; now what do you think of th'
grand opportunity?"</p>

<p>"It was there; I started too late!" snapped Holbrook
angrily. "If Art an' Purdy had any sense, one
of 'em would 'a' jumped for that trail when th' first
rock came down, instead of duckin' around these bowlders
like a pair of sage hens. I didn't wake up till th'
show was 'most over; an' I got within a hundred yards
at that. Five minutes more an' I'd 'a' been layin' behind
a rock waitin' for him to come back. It would
'a' been all over by now."</p>

<p>"Well, don't try it again," said Quigley. "He's
got all th' best of it up there. We'll give him a week
for his grub to peter out before we force things. An'
there ain't no use of all of us stayin' out here. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
is th' only way he can come down. Two of us out here
is plenty, takin' turns watchin' th' trail. An' if you
keep a fire burnin' you both could almost sleep nights.
He'd never tackle it. Purdy, you an' Art clear out
for th' ranch at daylight. Me an' Holbrook will stay
here tomorrow an' tomorrow night, when you fellers
can relieve us. I'd feel better, anyhow, if there was
somebody besides Ben an' th' cook in them houses.
You can't tell what might happen. It'll be light in an
hour, so I'll go over an' start some breakfast."</p>

<p>"Say, Tom," said Fleming. "Make yore camp up
on th' other Twin, an' get out of this cussed hole with
its heat an' its pests. Th' man off guard could get a
real sleep up there. But, of course, you'll have to do
th' cookin' down here, where there's water handy."</p>

<p>"See about that later," answered Quigley. "Anyhow,
we can sleep up there without shiftin' th' camp,"
and he disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>Fleming rolled a cigarette by sense of touch and
thoughtlessly struck a match. <i>Spang!</i> said a bowlder
at his side. <i>Ping-ing-ing-g-g!</i> sang the ricochet down
the canyon.</p>

<p>"Put it out!" yelled Holbrook, diving for cover.</p>

<p>"You d&mdash;d fool!" sputtered Purdy from behind a
pile of rocks.</p>

<p>"Beats all how careless a feller will get," laughed
Fleming as he slid behind a rock. "I plumb forgot!"</p>

<h2 id="XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
AN UNWELCOME VISITOR</h2></div>


<p>Dawn broke, and as the light increased Holbrook
saw a column of smoke arising from the southern
Twin like a faint streamer of gauze. A slender
pole raised and stood erect, and his suspicious mind
sought a reason for it.</p>

<p>"Wonder if he's tryin' to signal somebody? Long
Pete! I reckon he don't know Pete's dead. He'll not
see <i>him</i> this side of h&mdash;l," he muttered, settling in a
more comfortable position to go to sleep.</p>

<p>The pole swayed as a rope shot over it and grew
taut, and then a faded shirt, heavy with water, came
into view and sagged the rope.</p>

<p>Holbrook grinned and picked up his rifle. "Gettin'
th' wash out early. An' he must have plenty of water,
to waste it like that."</p>

<p>He raised the sight a little and tried again. "Can't
tell where they're goin'," he grumbled, and tried the
third time. The edge of the shirt flopped inward as
the garment momentarily assumed the general shape
of a funnel.</p>

<p>"He ain't th' only ki-yote that can shoot," chuckled
the marksman. "Fleming couldn't 'a' done any better'n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that. Bet he's mad. Serves him right for havin'
two. He ain't no better than me, an' I only got one,
since Ackerman took my other one. Cuss it!" he
swore, blinking rapidly and spitting as a sharp <i>spat!</i>
sent sand into his face.</p>

<p>He shifted, wiped his lips, and peered out at a spot
on the other butte where a cloud of smoke spread out
along the ground. Then he poked his sombrero over
the breastwork and wriggled it on a stick, but waited in
vain for the expected shot.</p>

<p>"He ain't bitin' today; an' he's savin' his cartridges.
Well, <i>I</i> got plenty; so here goes for that shirt again."</p>

<p>Again the inoffensive garment flopped; and then a
singing bullet passed squarely through Holbrook's expensive
sombrero.</p>

<p>"You stay down from up there!" grunted Holbrook
at the hat. "Plumb center! I got a lot of respect for
that hombre. He got th' best of th' swap, too. I
spoiled a worn-out shirt, an' he ventilated a twenty dollar
Stetson. He owes me a couple more shots!"</p>

<p>The next shot missed, but the second turned the shirt
into another funnel.</p>

<p>"Hey!" shouted an angry voice. "What you think
yo're doin'?"</p>

<p>Holbrook's grin turned into a burst of laughter as
the pole swiftly descended, and he again poked up his
hat, hoping for a miss and another wasted cartridge;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
but, failing to draw a shot, he gave it up and crawled
back to a safer and more comfortable place where he
lay down to get some sleep.</p>

<p>Johnny, full of wrath, worked along the edge of
the butte in a vain endeavor to catch sight of his enemy,
and he took plenty of time in his efforts to be
cautious. Any man who could hit a shirt plumb center
and nearly every time, at that distance, shooting
across a deceptive canyon and against the sky, was no
one to get careless with. After waiting a while without
hearing any more from his humorous enemy, he
looked down each trail and then went to the other end
of the butte.</p>

<p>Not far from him a slender column of smoke arose
from a box-like depression which lay beyond a high
ridge and was well protected from his rifle. Peering
cautiously over the rim of the butte, his head hidden
in a tuft of grass, he critically examined the canyon,
bowlder by bowlder, ridge by ridge. A puff of smoke
spurted from a pile of rocks and a malignant whine
passed over his head. Wriggling back, he hurried to
another point fifty yards to his right, where he again
crept to the edge and looked down. Another puff of
smoke and a bloody furrow across his cheek told him
that the marksman had good eyes and knew how to
shoot. Johnny drove a Sharp's Special into the middle
of the smoke and heard an angry curse follow it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hey, Nelson!" called a peeved voice from the
rocks. "Nelson!"</p>

<p>"What you belly-achin' about?" demanded Johnny
insolently.</p>

<p>"How'd you like to join us instead of fightin' us?"</p>

<p>"Yo're loco!" retorted Johnny. "Can't you think
of anything better'n that? I cut my eye-teeth long
ago."</p>

<p>"I mean it," said Quigley, earnestly. "Mean it all
th' way through. We talked it over last night. It's
poor business fightin' each other when we might be
workin' together. Laugh if you want to; but lemme
tell you it ain't as foolish as you think. It's a lazy,
independent life; an' there's good money in it. You'd
do better with us than you'd 'a' done alone."</p>

<p>"I've shore fooled 'em!" chuckled Johnny softly.
Aloud he said: "I can't trust you, not after what's happened."</p>

<p>"I reckon you <i>are</i> suspicious; an' nobody can blame
you," replied Quigley. "But I mean it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you make this play when I was in my
valley, pannin' gold an' gettin' a little herd together?"
demanded Johnny. "<i>You</i> knowed I wasn't after no
gold; an' you knowed what I <i>was</i> after. But no; you
was hoggin' th' earth an' too cussed mean to give a
man a chance, an' make another split in yore profits.
You burned&mdash;oh, what's th' use? If you want my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
answer, stick yore head out an' I'll give it to you
quick!"</p>

<p>"I know we acted hasty," persisted Quigley;
"but some of us was ag'in it. Three of 'em are dead
now; Ackerman's missin'. We'll give you th' share
of one of 'em in th' herd that we got now; an' an equal
share of what we get from now on. That's fair; an'
it more than makes up for yore cabin an' them six cows.
As far as <i>they</i> are concerned, we'll give you all of what
they bring. How about it?"</p>

<p>"Reckon it's too late," replied Johnny. "I ain't
takin' nobody's share. I'm aimin' to take th' whole
layout, lock, stock, an' barrel. Why should I give you
fellers any share in it? What'll you give me if I let
you all clear out now?"</p>

<p>"What you mean?" demanded Quigley.</p>

<p>"Just what I said," retorted Johnny. "There's
six of you now. It ought to be worth something to you
fellers to be allowed to stay alive. I'll throw off half
for th' wounded men&mdash;let 'em off at half price. What
are you fellers willin' to pay me if I let you leave th'
country with a cayuse apiece an' all yore personal belongin's?"</p>

<p>"This ain't no time for jokin'!" snapped Quigley
angrily.</p>

<p>"I ain't jokin' a bit! I'll have yore skins pegged
out to dry before I get through with you. Yo're a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
bunch of sap-headed jackasses, with no more sense
than a sheep-herder. I'm 'most ashamed to get you;
but I'm stranglin' my shame. You pore mutton-heads!"</p>

<p>Quigley's language almost seared the vegetation
and he was threatened with spontaneous combustion.
When he paused for breath he swung his rifle up and
pulled the trigger, almost blind with rage. Johnny's
answering shot ripped through his forearm and he felt
the awful sickness which comes when a bone is scraped.
Half fainting, Quigley dropped his rifle and leaned
back against a rock, regarding the numbed and bleeding
arm with eyes which saw the landscape turning
over and over. Gathering his senses by a great effort
of will, he steadied himself and managed to make and
apply a rough bandage with the clumsy aid of one hand
and his teeth.</p>

<p>"I'll give you till tomorrow mornin' to make me an
offer," shouted Johnny; "but don't get reckless before
then, because th' temptation shore will be more than I
can stand. Think it over."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n his measly hide!" moaned Quigley, his anger
welling up anew. "Give him our ranch, an' cows,
an' <i>pay</i> him to <i>let</i> us leave th' country! Six of us! Six
gun-fightin', law-breakin' cattle-liftin' cow-punchers;
sane, healthy, an' as tough as rawhide rope, payin' <i>him</i>,
a lone man up a tree, to let us leave th' country! All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
right, you conceited pup; you'll pay, an' pay well, for
that insult!"</p>

<p>He still was indulging in the luxury of an occasional
burst of profanity when Holbrook approached the
bowlders on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>"I'm still hungry; an' I can't sleep unless I'm full of
grub," apologized the rustler. "An' I heard shootin'.
What's th' matter, Tom? Yore language ain't fit for
innercent ears!"</p>

<p>"Matter?" roared Quigley, going off in another
flight of oratory. "Matter?" he shouted. "Look at
this arm! An' listen to what that &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; carrion-eatin'
squaw's dog of a &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; had th' &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
gall to say!"</p>

<p>As the recital unfolded Holbrook leaned back
against a rock and laughed until the tears washed clean
furrows through the dust and dirt on his face; and the
more he laughed the more his companion's anger
arose. Finally Quigley could stand it no longer, and
he loosed a sudden torrent of verbal fire upon his howling
friend.</p>

<p>Holbrook feebly wiped his eyes with the backs of
his dusty hands, which smeared the dirt over the wet
places and gave him a grotesque appearance.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I laugh?" he choked, and then became
indignant. "Why shouldn't I?" he demanded.
"I've laughed at yore jokes, Fleming's stories, Cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>ie's
cookin', an' Dan'l Boone's windy lies; an' now
when something funny comes along you want me to be
like th' chief mourner at a funeral! I'm forty years
old an' I've met some stuck-up people in my life; but
that fool up there has got more gall an' conceit than
anybody I ever even heard tell of! I'm glad <i>I</i> didn't
hear him say it, or I shore would 'a' laughed myself
plumb to death. Did you ever hear anything like it:
drunk or sober, <i>did</i> you?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't!" snapped Quigley. "An' if you've
got all over yore nonsense, suppose you take a look at
my arm, an' fix this bandage right!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Tom," answered Holbrook quickly; "but
I was near keeled over. Here, gimme that arm; an'
when I get it fixed right, you make a bee-line for th'
ranch. There ain't no use of you stayin' out here
with an arm like that. Good Lord! He shore made
a mess of it! Them slugs of his are awful; an' that
gun is th' worst <i>I</i> ever went up ag'in. <i>I</i> want that
rifle; an' I speaks for it here an' now. When we get
him, I get th' gun."</p>

<p>"It's yourn," groaned Quigley. "Gimme a drink
of whiskey before I start out. But I don't like to leave
you to handle this alone. I can stick it out."</p>

<p>"It's a one-man job until somebody comes out," responded
Holbrook. "All I got to do is lay low an'
not let him come down that trail. A ten-year-old kid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
can do that durin' daylight. But you ain't goin' to go
till you feel a little better," he ordered, producing a
flask. "You wait a while&mdash;th' sun won't be hot for
a couple of hours yet. An' would you look at th' mosquitoes!
They must 'a' smelled th' blood. Here,
wrap yore coat around it or they'll pump it full of
pizen."</p>

<p>Two hours later, Quigley having departed for the
ranch, Holbrook lay on the top of the northern Twin,
glad to have escaped from the attacks of the winged
pests which had driven him out of the canyon; and
hoping that his enemy would try to take advantage of
the situation, if he knew of it, and try to escape. He
had decided that he could guard the trail as well from
the top of the butte as he could from the canyon, for
the whole length of the steeply sloping path lay before
him. Cool breezes played about him, there were neither
flies, mosquitoes, nor yellow-jackets to plague him,
and the opposite butte and the whole canyon lay under
his eyes. And he also had better protection than the
canyon afforded, for there was always present a vague
uneasiness, no matter how well hidden he might be,
while his good-shooting enemy was five hundred feet
above him. Food and water were close to his hand
and he enjoyed a smoke as he lazily sprawled behind
his protecting breastwork of rocks and set himself the
task of keeping awake and alert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>He had seen no sign of his enemy, although he had
closely scrutinized every foot of the opposite butte.
Quigley, he thought, must have reached the ranch by
that time and no doubt Fleming or Purdy was on the
way to relieve him. As he glanced along the canyon
in the direction that his friend would appear he saw a
movement of the brush near the bottom of the much
watched trail and he slid his rifle through an opening between
the rocks covering the center of the disturbance.</p>

<p>It was too early for Fleming or Purdy, he reflected;
and his eyes narrowed as he wondered if it could be
some friend of the man he was watching.</p>

<p>The bushes moved again and a grizzled head thrust
out into view, slowly followed by a pair of massive
shoulders as a great silver-tip grizzly pushed out into
the little clearing where the guarding fire had been,
and slowly turned its head from side to side, sniffing
suspiciously. Satisfied that there was nothing to fear,
it crossed the clearing and ripped the bark off of a dead
and fallen tree trunk, licking up the grubs and the
scurrying insects. Shredding the bark and thoroughly
cleaning up the last of the grubs, it sat down and lazily
regarded the towering butte.</p>

<p>Holbrook watched it with interest, for there was
something almost human in the great bear's actions, a
comical gravity and a deftness of paws which brought
a grin to his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>The bear arose clumsily, scratched itself, and proceeded
toward the trail in that awkward, lumbering
way which conveys such a vivid impression of tremendous
strength and power. Holbrook knew that the
lazy, clumsy shuffling, the indolent thrust of the
rounded shoulders and the slow, deliberate reaching
of the great legs, the forefeet flipping quickly forward,
hid an amazing, deceptive quickness and agility,
and a devastating strength. Sleepy, peaceful, and
good natured as the beast appeared, its temper was always
on edge and its heart knew nothing of fear when
that temper was aroused; and he also knew that the
vitality in that grub, insect, and berry-fed body was
almost beyond belief, that a clean, heart shot would
not stop it instantly.</p>

<p>The animal waddled onto the trail and paused to
turn over a rock, licked up a few scurrying bugs and
waddled on again, the great shoulders rising and falling
with each deliberate step. A pause, and the red
tongue wiped out a procession of hard-working ants,
and again it lumbered upward.</p>

<p>"Nelson is due to have company; an' plenty of it!"
chuckled Holbrook; "an' if he slides any lead into th'
wrong place under that flea-bitten hide he'll find that
butte is a cussed lot smaller than he ever thought it
was. Ah-ha! Cussed if th' yellow-jackets ain't declarin'
war on him! Just wait till his snout gets well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
stung, an' he'll be ready an' eager to fight anything
that lives!"</p>

<p>The bear was moving swiftly now, but pausing frequently
to scrape his smarting snout with one paw or
the other, and it was beginning to show signs of irritation
as the swarming yellow-jackets warmed to the
attack.</p>

<p>"Gettin' riled more every minute!" grinned Holbrook.
"I'd hate to run foul of him now! Mr. Nelson
shore is goin' to have a grand an' busy little seance
up there, unless that Sharp's of his gets home plumb
center th' first crack. He'll mebby wish it was a repeater.
That old varmint must be nine feet long, an'
just plumb full of rage. I can imagine them wicked little
eyes of hisn gettin' redder an' redder every minute.
An' one swipe of them paws would cave in th' side of
th' biggest steer on th' range. It's a cussed good
thing grizzlies ain't got th' speed an' habits of mountain
lions&mdash;they'd be th' most dangerous things on
earth if they had."</p>

<p>The bear sat down suddenly and dragged himself a
few feet, and then ran on at top speed.</p>

<p>Holbrook roared with laughter. "Ho! Ho! Ho!
This is goin' to be as much fun as a circus! D&mdash;d if
I'd miss it for a week's pay! Go on. Old Timer;
steam up!"</p>

<p>Free at last from the stinging attacks of the yellow-jackets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the great bear suddenly stopped, squatted back
on his haunches and rubbed his head and snout with
both paws; and then, looking across the canyon at the
place the laughter was coming from, slouched back
on four legs and waddled rapidly upward, his huge
body twisting ponderously at each step. Reaching the
top he paused while he surveyed his immediate vicinity,
looked back down the trail, glanced across the
canyon again, and then slowly disappeared among the
rocks and bowlders.</p>

<p>Holbrook shifted his rifle to a more comfortable position
across his knees and leaned forward expectantly,
grinning in keen anticipation, his cigarette cold and
forgotten between his lips. It was just possible that
there might be more in the coming show for him than
amusement, for Mr. Nelson, intent, very, very intent,
upon his part of a game of tag among the bowlders,
might forget for a moment and carelessly show himself
long enough to become a promising target.</p>

<p>"Wonder how much he'll take, purty soon, to <i>let</i>
Ol' Silver-tip leave th' country along with us?" he
chuckled. "I wish Tom was here!"</p>

<p>Johnny opened his eyes at Pepper's snort and
glanced at the horse, which trembled in every limb and
whose big eyes were ablaze with terror. She had
jerked the picket rope loose from under the rock which
had held it, but was rigid with fear. Sitting bolt up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>right
as he jerked out a Colt, Johnny glanced in the
direction of Pepper's stare and then left the blanket to
take care of itself. Twenty paces distant was the
Sharp's, loaded and lying on a rock, and he hotly
cursed the stupidity and carelessness which had caused
him to go to sleep so far away from the weapon. It
was the first time such a thing had happened in weeks,
and he instantly resolved that it never would happen
again. Between him and the rifle was the biggest,
meanest looking grizzly it ever had been his misfortune
to face.</p>

<p>The unwelcome visitor had finished a pan of beans
and a pan of rice and had its nose jammed in the last
can of sugar that Johnny owned. Observing his unwilling
host's acrobatic leap and the flying blanket, the
huge animal pushed the sugar can from its swollen
nose with a cunningly curved paw, and heaved itself
onto its four legs, regarding the puncher with a frankly
curious and belligerent stare. The little eyes were
wicked and bloodshot and one of them was nearly
closed from the stings of the yellow-jackets. Altogether
it was as unpleasant a sight as anyone would care
to look upon at such close range.</p>

<p>Behind Johnny was the rock wall, rising fifteen feet
above the bottom of the little rock basin, and it curved
slightly outward at the top. On one side were scattered
several great bowlders, and he kept these in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
mind as he glanced quickly behind him at the wall,
which was smooth and devoid of hand-holds.</p>

<p>He had killed a grizzly with a six-shooter, but no
such an animal as the one facing him; and a Colt was
not a weapon to be eagerly used, especially at such
close quarters, where a sudden rush might be fatal to
the user. He knew the thickness of the bone over the
little brain, and keenly realized the smallness of the
eyes as a target in the slowly moving head; if he could
maneuver the animal to give him a heart shot he would
have a fair chance.</p>

<p>"G'wan away from here!" he ordered peremptorily,
with an assurance in his voice which he did not feel.
"Pull your stakes, you big tramp, or I'll bust yore
neck!"</p>

<p>Bruin refused to heed him; instead, the animal
shuffled forward, its head wagging, and Johnny also
stepped forward, on his toes, yelled loudly and waved
his arms. Bruin paused and looked him over. Johnny
side-stepped toward the rifle, but the bear pivoted
quickly, swung around and declared its intentions with
a low but entirely sufficient growl.</p>

<p>Johnny figured quickly. He might beat his visitor
to the gun, but he strongly doubted if he would lead
by a margin large enough to have time to swing the
weapon to his shoulder and obtain the nicety of aim
necessary to stop his pursuer as suddenly as the occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>sion
demanded. The bowlders remained as his other
alternative, and as the bear took its second step, which
was the beginning of the rush, Johnny made a very
creditable leap in the direction of the bowlders, gained
the first by ten feet to spare, vaulted the second, dashed
around the third and streaked up the slope leading to
the top of the rocky wall behind the pool.</p>

<p>As he gained the top a bullet hummed past his head,
but it received no recognition from him, for the bear
also was hustling up the slope, thoroughly aroused
and abrim with energy and ambition. Jerking out his
Colts, he emptied one of them into the rushing animal
as he leaped aside to get behind another bowlder.
The bear slowed for an instant as the six heavy
slugs ripped into it, and then, loosing a roar that
awoke the echoes, it gathered speed and slid around
the rock, clawing desperately to make a short turn.
Johnny emptied his second gun into the enraged animal
as he dodged around another rock, and then,
dropping both Colts into their holsters, he sprinted
for the top of the wall as Holbrook's second bullet
loosened a heel and almost threw him.</p>

<p>Reaching the edge he launched himself from it, recovered
his balance like an acrobat and dashed for his
rifle as the grizzly, reaching the edge, checked himself
barely in time and hunted hurriedly for a way to
get down the wall. Giving it up in an instant, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
animal drew up its forelegs with a pivoting swing,
and started at full speed along the edge, to go down
the way it had come up. This exposed its left side,
and the Sharp's, already at Johnny's shoulder, steadied
upon the vital spot as he timed the swing of the
great foreleg. There was a sharp roar, and an ounce
and a quarter of lead smashed through skin and flesh,
squarely into the animal's heart. The great beast collapsed,
slid around and raised its head; but again the
heavy rifle spoke and the massive head dropped limply,
for the stopping power of a Sharp's Special is tremendous.</p>

<p>Johnny jerked out the smoking shell, slid another
great cartridge into place, and then sat down on the
rock, wiping his face with his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Hey!" called a distant voice. "Want any help
with th' varmints?"</p>

<p>Johnny grabbed his rifle and slipped to the edge of
the butte. Holbrook called again, carelessly exposing
his shoulder; and then cursed the bullet which
grooved it.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything more for <i>you</i>?" jeered Johnny.</p>

<h2 id="XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
A PAST MASTER DRAWS CARDS</h2></div>


<p>Back on the CL the foreman was worried about
his new, two-gun man, and had almost made up
his mind to order the outfit into the saddle and to lead
it up into the Twin Buttes country to aid Johnny.
While he was turning the matter over in his mind he
entered the bunk-house and saw Luke Tedrue, the oldest
man on the ranch, dressed in a clean shirt, new
trousers, and a pair of new boots. Luke looked surprisingly
clean and he was busily engaged in cleaning
and oiling the parts of an old .44 caliber Remington
six-shooter, one of those early models which had been
transformed from its original cap-and-ball class into
a weapon shooting center-fire cartridges. It had been
the butt of many joking remarks and the old man cherished
it, and had defended it in many a hot, verbal
skirmish. Considering its age and use it was in a remarkably
fine state of preservation.</p>

<p>Luke had played many parts in his day, for he had
been a hunter, frontiersman, scout, pony-express rider,
miner, and cavalryman, and as an Indian fighter he
had admitted but few masters. Tough, wiry, shrewd,
enduring, of flawless courage and bulldog tenacity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
purpose, he had behind him long years of experience;
and his appearance of age was as deceptive as the pose
of a basking rattler.</p>

<p>The lessons of such a long, precarious, and daring
life as he had led were not easily ignored, and now
as a cow-puncher, riding out his declining days on the
range, there were certain habits which clung to him
with the strength of instinct. One of these was his
faith in a weapon almost universally condemned on
the range. It mattered nothing to him that times and
conditions had changed; he had proved its worth in
years of fighting, and now he refused to lay it aside.
There had been a day when Bowie's terrible weapon
had entered largely into the life of the long frontier.</p>

<p>Logan, worried and preoccupied as he was, could
not keep from smiling at the old man's patient labor.</p>

<p>"Luke, you waste more time an' elbow grease on
that worn-out old relic than most people do with <i>real</i>
guns. Th' whole outfit, put together, don't pamper
their six-guns th' way you do that contraption. Why
don't you throw it away an' get a <i>good</i> gun?"</p>

<p>Luke snorted, and screwed the walnut butt-plates into
place. Then he slipped the cylinder into position, slid
the pin through it, swung up the old ramrod lever and
snapped it into its catch under the barrel. Spinning
the cylinder, he weighed the heavy weapon affectionately,
and looked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Luke grunted. "Huh! Mebby that's why old
Betsy is a better gun today than any in this outfit.
Why should I get a new one? This old Rem. has
been a cussed good friend of mine. She's never balked
nor laid down, an' she puts 'em where she's pointed.
An old friend like her ain't goin' to rust if I can help
it."</p>

<p>"Rust?" inquired Logan, chuckling. "Why, there
ain't been enough moisture in th' air lately to rust
anything, let alone any gun that's as full of grease an'
oil as that contraption. Wait till th' rainy season hits
us before you worry about rust. An' what are you all
dressed up for? When I saw you this mornin' you
was th' dirtiest man on th' ranch; an' now you fair
shines! Ain't aimin' to go an' hitch up with no female,
are you?"</p>

<p>Luke shoved home the last greasy cartridge, snapped
shut the hinged flange, laid the gun aside, and pointed
to a pile of wet clothing on the floor near his bunk.</p>

<p>"There ain't no female livin' can put a rope on me
no more," he grinned. "See them clothes? I done
fell in th' crick. Some slab-sided nuisance shifted th'
planks an' was too lazy to put 'em back right. They
tip sideways. I got half way acrost an' up she turns.
Lost my balance an' lit belly-whopper. But I put 'em
back just like I found 'em."</p>

<p>"An' you'll get an innercent man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"There ain't none in this outfit," grunted Luke.
He searched the foreman's face with shrewd eyes.
"John, worryin' never did help a man. Get shet of
it, or it'll get shet of you."</p>

<p>"Easy said, Ol' Timer; but it ain't so easy done,"
replied Logan.</p>

<p>Luke kicked his wet holster toward the clothes and
took down one belonging to someone else, and calmly
appropriated it, belt and all.</p>

<p>"Two most generally splits a load about in half,"
he observed, shoving the gun into the sheath. "An'
it allus helps a lot to talk things over with somebody."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't heard a word from Nelson since he
left that note tellin' me where he was goin' an' for me
not to bother about our five-day arrangement; an' he
shore started off to wrastle with trouble."</p>

<p>"Huh!" snorted Luke grimly. "Dunno as I'd do
much worryin' about him. Real active, capable hombre,
he is. Chain lightnin', an' an eye like a hawk.
A few years more an' he'll steady down an' get sensible.
Lord, what a fool <i>I</i> was at his age! Beats all
how young men ever live long enough to become old
ones."</p>

<p>"But he's been gone a month," replied Logan.
"It's been two weeks since I heard from him, an'
longer. He's playin' a lone hand ag'in them fellers,
an' it ain't no one-man job, not by a d&mdash;d sight! He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was to find out certain things an' then come back here
an' report. Why ain't he got back?"</p>

<p>"Busy, mebby," grunted Luke. "I have an idea th'
job would keep one man purty tolerable busy, with
one thing an' another turning up. He don't want to
get seen an' tip off his hand; an' keepin' under cover
takes time."</p>

<p>"I should 'a' taken th' outfit up there an' combed th'
hills, regardless what anybody said about squarin' up
old scores."</p>

<p>"What you should 'a' done, an' what you <i>did</i> do
don't track," replied Luke. "An' I ain't shore that
you oughta 'a' busted loose like that a-tall. It's a good
thing most generally to know where yo're goin' to
light before you jump. What you should 'a' done
was to 'a' sent me up there, either alone or with him.
'Tain't too late to deal me a hand. Where'd he say
he was goin'?"</p>

<p>"West of Twin Buttes. But if you go it'll be a one-man
job again, an' I don't like it."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh!" chuckled Luke. "That's just what it is;
an' I <i>do</i> like it. I drove stage, carried dispatches
through Injun country, an' was th' boss scout for th'
two best army officers that ever fit Injuns. Reckon
mebby if th' Injuns couldn't lift my scalp, no gang
of thievin' cow-punchers can skin it off. An' I'm
cussed tired of punchin' cows. I ain't no puncher by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
nature, hopes, or inclinations. I'm a scout, <i>I</i> am; an'
I'm goin' up there somewhere west of th' Twins an'
find Nelson, if he's still alive, get them facts an' bring
'em back."</p>

<p>"I don't like th' idea," muttered Logan.</p>

<p>"Huh! I ain't got them fool notions that Nelson
has. I ain't no Christian when I'm on a war trail. He
worries about givin' th' other feller an even break;
but I worries if I lets him have it. Greasers, thieves,
an' Injuns&mdash;they're all alike; an' they don't get no
even break from me if I can help it. I puts th' worryin'
right up to them. I'll bet he's alive, an' workin'
all th' time; but he ain't got no chance to get quick
results; an' it's his own handicappin', too. When a
man's scoutin' around a whole passel of rustlers, a
gun has got its limits. Gimme a pair of moccasins an'
ol' Colonel Bowie."</p>

<p>"I likes you purty much; but d&mdash;d if I thinks much
of any man that uses a knife!"</p>

<p>Luke laughed grimly and got the knife from his
bunk. "There he is. He don't make a man no deader
than a bullet; an' he don't make no noise. There
ain't nothin' handier in a mix-up&mdash;an' a good man
can drive it straight as any bullet, too. I'm gettin' het
up considerable about all this palaver about this knife
an' me; an' I'm goin' to lick th' next man that rides
me about it. It's a' honest weapon. It was ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
out of a two-inch hoof file, an' when it cuts through
th' air it takes considerable to stop it. When I was
younger I could send it so far into a two-inch plank
that you could feel th' pint of it on th' other side.
Just feel th' heft an' balance of that blade!"</p>

<p>"Feel it yoreself!" snapped Logan. "That ain't
fair fightin'; an' if you don't like that, you can start in
here an' now an' lick me."</p>

<p>"I never said I was a fair fighter," grinned Luke,
slipping the weapon into a scabbard sewed to the inside
of his boot; "but old as I am, I can put yore
shoulders in th' dust. We'll argue instead. Them fellers
ain't fair fighters; they dassn't be even if they
wanted to be; an' when I'm tanglin' up with 'em I ain't
polite a-tall. I just fights, knife, gun, teeth, hands,
feet, an' head, any way as comes handy. That's why
I'm still alive, too. Now I'm goin' up somewhere west
of th' Buttes an' look around from there; an' Colonel
Bowie goes with me, right where he is. Tell th' cook
to give me what grub I wants. An' I reckon I better
take Nelson some ca'tridges an' tobacco."</p>

<p>"Tell him yoreself; an' if he won't do it, I'll tell
you who moved th' planks," grinned Logan. "But I
hate to see you go alone."</p>

<p>"An' I'd hate to have anybody along," grunted
Luke. "I'll be busy enough takin' care of myself
without botherin' with a fool puncher."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The old scout sauntered into the kitchen. "Mat,
you sage hen; th' next time you shifts them planks,
put a stone under th' edges that don't touch th' ground.
You near drownded me in three inches of water an'
a foot of mud. Now you gimme a chunk of bacon,
couple pounds of flour, three pounds of beans, couple
of pounds of that rice, 'though I ain't real fascinated
by it, couple handfuls of coffee, handful of salt, an'
a pound of tobacco. I may be gone a couple of months
an' get real hungry. Nope; no canned grub. I
want this fryin' pan, that tin cup, an' a fork."</p>

<p>He sniffed eagerly and strode to a covered pan.
"Beans, ready cooked! Mat, you was hidin' them!
Dump some of 'em into a cloth&mdash;now I won't have
to cook my first couple of meals. Stick all th' stuff in
a sack, them on top," and he hurried out.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Logan entered Mat's domain.
"Where's Luke? What, already? Must 'a' been
scared I'd change my mind. Why, he left his pipe
an' smokin' behind," pointing at the table.</p>

<p>Mat grinned. "He says a smoker can't smell, an'
gets smelled. An' he says for somebody to go up to
Little Canyon for his bronc. He's leavin' it there tonight,
hobbled. An' take that pipe out of here; I
don't want them beans ruined."</p>

<p>Luke was crossing the CL range at a gallop, anxious
to cross the river and get past the Hope-Hastings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
trail before dark. Reaching the Deepwater he forced
his indignant horse into it and emerged, chilled, on
the farther bank. Hobbling the animal, he put his
boots on the saddle, slipped on a pair of moccasins,
fastened the pack on his back and swung into the canyon,
his mind busily forming a mental map of the
country.</p>

<p>Placing Hope at one end and Hastings at the other,
he connected them by the trail, putting in the Deepwater,
the Barrier, and Twin Buttes.</p>

<p>"They comes to Hastings 'stead of Hope, which
says Hastings is nearest. He said west of Twin
Buttes. Then I'll start at th' Buttes an' go west till I
find his trail; an' if I don't find it, I'll circle 'round till
I finds <i>something</i>! I'd know that black cayuse's
tracks in a hundred.</p>

<p>"Logan sent Nelson up here because nobody knowed
him an' that he was workin' for us. Huh! What
good will it do 'em to know a man if they never see
him? An' they won't see me, 'less I wants 'em to.
That water feels colder than it ought to&mdash;reckon I'm
gettin' old. I shore ain't as young as I uster be.
Got to move lively to get thawed out an' dry these
clothes."</p>

<p>Crossing the main trail after due observation, he
saw an old and well-worn trail leading westward into
a deep valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh! Hit it first shot. You just can't beat
luck!"</p>

<p>Choosing the cover along one side of the smaller
trail, he melted into it and plunged westward, swinging
along with easy, lazy strides that covered ground
amazingly and with a minimum of effort. His long
legs swung free from his hips, the hips rolling into the
movement; his knees were rather stiff and as his feet
neared the ground at the end of each stride he pushed
them ahead a little more before they touched. This
was where the swaying hips gave him an added thrust
of inches. And like all natural, sensible walkers, his
toes turned in.</p>

<p>Night was coming on when he neared Twin Buttes
and a rifle shot in their direction drew a chuckle from
him. Throwing off the pack he ate his fill of Mat's
cooked beans, shoved the wrapped-up remainder into
his shirt, hid the pack and slipped into the deeper
shadows, his rifle on his back, the old Remington in
one hand and Colonel Bowie lying along the other, its
handle up his sleeve and the keen point extending beyond
his fingers.</p>

<p>A coyote might have heard him moving, but the
task was beyond human ears; and after a few minutes
he stopped suddenly and sniffed. The faint odor
of a fire told him that he was getting close to a camp,
and a moment later a distant flare lit up the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>-tops
in the canyon proper. Looking down he noticed
the buckle of his belt, thought that it was too bright,
and wrapped a bandanna handkerchief around it. Slipping
the six-shooter into its holster he moved forward
again, bent over, going swiftly and silently,
his feet avoiding twigs, branches, and pebbles as
though he had eyes in his toes. Rounding the southern
Twin he melted into the darkness at the side of a
bowlder and peered cautiously over the rock.</p>

<p>A great, crackling fire sent its flames towering high
in the air from a little clearing at the lower end of a
path which went up the side of the butte and became
lost in the darkness. Examining the scene with shrewd,
keen, and appraising eyes, he waited patiently. A
burst of fire darted from the top of the northern Twin
and a strange voice jeered softly in the distance. From
the top of the southern butte came an answering jeer
in a voice which he instantly recognized.</p>

<p>"Treed, by G-d!" he chuckled gleefully. "Reckon
he'll be tickled to see me. Wonder how long he's been
up there?"</p>

<p>A piece of wood curved into the circle of illumination
and landed on the blazing fire, sending a stream
of sparks soaring up the mesa wall.</p>

<p>"There's Number Two," soliloquized Luke cheerfully,
"feedin' th' fire an' watchin' th' trail. Cuss him
for a fool! Some of them sparks will get loose, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
hell will be a nice, quiet place compared to this canyon.
Well, now I got to rustle around an' locate 'em all;
an' this ain't no place or time for no shootin', neither."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Fleming tossed more wood on
the fire and settled back to fight mosquitoes. A glittering
streak shot through the air and he crumpled
without a sound. A shadow moved and a silent form
wriggled through the brush and among the bowlders
and retrieved the knife, took the dead man's weapons
and wriggled back again. It slipped noiselessly across
the canyon, searched along the base of the northern
Twin, found the wide, up-slanting trail and flitted along
it, pausing frequently to look, sniff, and listen. Reaching
the top of the butte, it wriggled from bowlder to
bowlder, ridge to ridge, systematically covering every
foot of the plateau, and steadily working nearer the
southern rim.</p>

<p>Holbrook yawned, stretched, and yawned again.
He picked up his rifle and scowled into the canyon,
where the fire engaged his critical attention.</p>

<p>"That lazy cuss is lettin' it burn too low," he
growled. "Wonder if he's asleep!" He laughed
and shook his head. "Nope; don't believe even Art
could sleep down there, with them mosquitoes pesterin'
him. <i>This</i> suits me, right here!"</p>

<p>He looked around uneasily. "I do so much layin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
around out here in daytime that I can't sleep nights,"
he grumbled, not willing to admit that he felt uneasy.
"Funny how a man's nerves will get hummin'
when he's on a job like this. It shore is monotonous."
Looking around again, he shifted so that he could see
part of the mesa top behind him, and tried to shake
off the premonition of evil which persisted in haunting
him.</p>

<p>"How many cows you thieves sold so far?" called
a voice from the other butte.</p>

<p>"Nowhere near as many as we're goin' to get," retorted
Holbrook, laughing. "Changin' yore mind?"
he jeered.</p>

<p>"Not me; I wouldn't work with no teethin' infants.
I'd rather work alone. I associates with <i>men, I</i> do."</p>

<p>"You'll 'sociate with dead men purty soon," sneered
Holbrook. "We got you just where we&mdash;" the
words choked into a gurgle and a lean, vague figure
moved slowly forward from behind a ridge.</p>

<p>"What's th' matter?" ironically demanded the man
on the southern Twin. "Swaller yore cigarette?
That's a good thing. You want to practice swallerin'
hot things because tomorrow yo're goin' to swaller
a snub-nosed Special." Pausing, Johnny waited expectantly
for an answer, but receiving none, he grunted
cheerfully. "All right; go to blazes!"</p>

<p>The fire burned lower and lower and Johnny be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>came
suspicious. If the rustler on the other butte
hoped to keep him engaged in snappy conversation
when the fire grew low, there was no telling what the
man in the canyon might do; so he crept to the top of
the trail and peered down it, scanning the wall intently,
half expecting to glimpse some swift, shadowy
movement; but his alertness was not rewarded.</p>

<p>"Wonder how long Hoppy or Red would loaf on
a game like this," he grinned, "if they was down there!
But there ain't many of their breed runnin' around."</p>

<p>An hour passed and the fire was a mass of glowing
embers, now and then relieved by a spasmodic burst
of flame, which flickered up and died. Across the little
clearing a shadowy form moved slowly backward,
chuckling softly. If there were any more rustlers
around, one of them certainly would have investigated
why the fire was allowed to die; and Luke felt quite
confident that he had accounted for all of them who
were in the vicinity. Still, he argued, nothing was a
certainty which depended upon circumstantial evidence,
and he did not relax his caution as he moved away.</p>

<p>Johnny, straining his eyes in trying to discover signs
of enemies on the trail, suddenly stiffened, listening
eagerly with every nerve taut. Again came the voice,
barely audible. Moving to the outer edge of the
butte he peered over cautiously, well knowing that he
could see nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tell Red his pants wear well,'" floated up to
him out of the canyon.</p>

<p>Johnny moved a little and leaned farther over after
a glance at the black sky assured him that he would
not be silhouetted for a marksman below.</p>

<p>"'Does William, Junior, chew tobacco?'" persisted
the whisper.</p>

<p>Johnny wriggled back and sat bolt upright, incredulous,
doubting his senses. "What th' devil!" he muttered.
"Am I loco?"</p>

<p>"'We was scared he'd die,'" continued the canyon.</p>

<p>Taking another good look down the threatening
trail, Johnny wriggled to the edge and again looked
down.</p>

<p>"'Pete paid Red th' eight dollars,'" said the chasm,
a little louder and with a note of irritation.</p>

<p>"Who th' devil are you?" demanded Johnny
loudly.</p>

<p>"Not so loud. Luke Tedrue," whispered the darkness.
"How many of them skunks are around here?"</p>

<p>"Yo're a liar!" retorted Johnny angrily. "An' a
fool!"</p>

<p>"Go to th' devil!" snapped the canyon.</p>

<p>"Come around in daylight an' I'll send you to
him!" growled Johnny. "Think I'm a fool?"</p>

<p>There was no answer, and, fearful of a trick, Johnny
wriggled back to his snug cover at the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
trail, finding that the fire had become only a dull, red
mass of embers which gave out almost no light.</p>

<p>"You shore got me guessin'," he grumbled; "but
I reckon mebby I'm guessin' purty good, at that. You
just try it, cuss you!"</p>

<p>Luke explored the canyon again to make assurance
doubly sure, and again approached the great wall.</p>

<p>"'Does William, Junior, chew tobacco?'" he demanded.</p>

<p>Johnny squirmed, but remained where he was.
"You can't fool me!" he shouted peevishly.</p>

<p>"Reckon not; yo're as wise as a jackass, a dead
one," said Luke. "You stubborn fool, listen to this;
'Don't look for no word from me. I'm goin' west, to
try it from back of Twin Buttes. They've drove me
out.'" The voice was plainer now. "How many of
'em are out here?"</p>

<p>Johnny grinned suddenly, for in the increase in the
power of the voice he recognized a friend.</p>

<p>"Hello, Luke, you old skunk!" he called, laughing.
"Glad to see you. There's four been hangin' around
but there's only two now, or three at th' most. Look
out for 'em. Goin' to try to come up?"</p>

<p>"No, not a-tall," replied Luke. "There's enough
of our outfit up there now. I only found two of th'
thieves, but th' third may be hid som'ers well back,
'though I've shore hunted a-plenty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Found two?"</p>

<p>"Yep; one down here, an' t'other up there. Colonel
Bowie pushed 'em over th' Divide. Comin' down?"</p>

<p>"When that fire's out."</p>

<p>"How'd they come to drive you up there?"</p>

<p>"I come up myself. Couldn't watch while I slept;
an' I had to sleep. Now that there's two of us it's all
right."</p>

<p>"You called th' turn. Get yore traps together an'
I'll fix th' fire. Where's yore cayuse?"</p>

<p>"Up here. Don't bother with th' fire. Be right
down."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Johnny reached the bottom of
the trail and paused.</p>

<p>"'Red's pants,'" said a humorous voice.</p>

<p>"Come on, Luke. We'll hold up somewhere an'
get th' relief shift when it comes out from th' ranch."</p>

<p>"Shore. Where's th' ranch?"</p>

<p>"'Bout three miles west; an' it's a cussed fine one,
too."</p>

<p>"All right; get movin'. I want to dry out these
pants. They must be all cotton from th' way they
feel. We'll go back a ways an' start a fire."</p>

<p>"No, we won't; too dangerous," growled Johnny
decidedly. "We got this game won right now if we
don't let 'em know there's two of us."</p>

<p>Luke grinned in the dark. "Suits me. You wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
here a minute," he said, disappearing. When he returned
he grunted with keen satisfaction, for Fleming's
trousers felt snug and warm. "How many are
left?" he asked, leading the way toward his hidden
pack.</p>

<p>"Quigley, Purdy, Gates, an' th' cook."</p>

<p>"Them names don't surprise me," grunted Luke.</p>

<p>"How'd you get so wet?"</p>

<p>"Swimmin'," growled Luke.</p>

<p>"Yore shirt feels dry."</p>

<p>"It is, around th' shoulders; but th' tail feels like
th' devil. But it's wool, all through."</p>

<p>"Was you trailin' Ackerman an' Long Pete?"</p>

<p>"Nope; didn't trail nobody a-tall. How many cows
they got?"</p>

<p>"Plenty, d&mdash;n 'em!" growled Johnny.</p>

<p>"What you been doin' up here all this time; an'
how many have you got?"</p>

<p>"Three; I've been busy."</p>

<p>"Why, you had time to get 'em all."</p>

<p>"Didn't dare do any shootin' till I had to," replied
Johnny. "Didn't want 'em to know I was up
here. A gun makes a lot of noise."</p>

<p>Luke chuckled grimly. "Shore! That's what I
<i>allus</i> said; an' that's why I use Colonel Bowie. He
don't even whisper."</p>

<p>Johnny snorted with disgust. "Huh! I ain't knifin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
or shootin' from ambush. There's <i>some</i> things I won't
do!"</p>

<p>"Uppish, huh?" chuckled Luke. "Well, young
man; mebby ambushin' ain't yore style, but I feels free
to remark that it's mine in any game like this. Them
pants feel good. That river's gettin' colder every
year."</p>

<p>"River!" ejaculated Johnny, pausing in his surprise.
"What river?"</p>

<p>"Deepwater, of course. How many rivers do you
reckon we got out here?"</p>

<p>"Th' devil!" muttered Johnny. "Say! When
did you leave th' ranch?"</p>

<p>"'Bout three o'clock. I'd 'a' been here sooner, only
I hoofed it from th' river. Cayuses can't go where a
man can; they make a lot of noise, an' a man sticks up
too cussed prominent in a saddle. They ain't worth a
cuss in this kind of country when trouble's afoot."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged!" grunted Johnny.</p>

<p>"Pull up; here we are," said Luke, stopping and
bending over some rocks, which he rolled aside.
"Rocks are reg'lar telltales. They has a dark side an'
a light side; an' th' deeper they're set in th' ground, th'
bigger th' dark side is. When you want to cache with
'em, you picks them that sets <i>on</i> th' ground; an' you
don't turn 'em wrong side up, neither. Then a little
sand used right will fix things so that only me or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Injun can tell that anything's been moved. Here's
yore ca'tridges an' tobacco. Tote 'em yoreself."</p>

<p>"Much obliged. But how did you find me so cussed
quick?" demanded Johnny, breaking open the boxes
and distributing their contents about his person.</p>

<p>"Smelled you," chuckled Luke, fixing the pack on
his back.</p>

<p>"Yo're an old liar!" retorted Johnny. "Tell me
about it."</p>

<p>"Can't; there ain't nothin' to tell," replied Luke,
winking at the sky. "It's just experience, instinct,
brains, knowin' how, an' a couple more things. Us old-timers
done better'n that, forty year ago. I'm glad
to get my hand in ag'in; punchin' cows shore does
spoil a man. Now, you know this layout; where we
goin' now? An' what you goin' to do with that four-laigged
nuisance?"</p>

<p>"Put her in a draw east of here. She'll stay where
I leave her."</p>

<p>"Then she ain't no fe-male. It just can't be did.
I know 'em!"</p>

<p>"You an' our Pete oughta get acquainted with each
other," chuckled Johnny. "You fellers has th' same
ideas 'bout some things."</p>

<p>"Foreman, or owner?"</p>

<p>"Just a plain puncher."</p>

<p>"He oughta be th' foreman; he's got sense. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
buried one, an' left two more. You can't fool me
about th' sex."</p>

<p>"Yo're a reprobate. Come on, Pepper," said
Johnny, whistling to the horse, who heeled like a dog.
"It'll be light purty soon, an' we want to hide this
cayuse."</p>

<p>"It's yore say-so; I'll string along, ready to chip."</p>

SCOUTING AS A FINE ART</h2></div>


<p>Quigley, favoring his injured arm, led the way
toward Twin Buttes to relieve the men on
guard, Purdy close behind him; and he did not stick
to the trail, but cut straight for his objective along a
way well known to both. He was not in good shape
for hard work or hard fighting, but he felt that his
place was on the scene of action, as befitted a chief;
and he had stubbornly battered down all the reasons
advanced by his companions at the ranch by which
they sought to dissuade him. It had to be either him
or the cook, for he was not as seriously wounded as
Gates.</p>

<p>The chief was the best man for leader that the outfit
contained, and if he had erred in being slack and
over-confident it was only because they never had
been molested seriously since they had taken to the
Twin Buttes country, and, with the exception of Ackerman,
he secretly felt less security than any of the
others. Thanks to his earlier activities and clever
distortion of facts as to why he had crossed the Deepwater
to live in the Buttes, the outfit had not been
bothered; and the Twin Buttes section had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
taboo, in recent years, to everyone, no man caring to
risk his life in penetrating that locality until Johnny
Nelson appeared. And although Ackerman had
preached disaster, he had preached it so long and so
much that he was regarded as a calamity howler.</p>

<p>There were two comparatively safe ways to reach
the Buttes, when once the last high, intervening ridge
was attained. One led to the far side of the northern
Twin and was hidden by it from the sight of anyone
on the other butte; the second course swept to the
south, running through arroyos and draws, and sheltered
by the dense growths of pine; and it not only
was a shorter and easier course, but allowed an occasional
glimpse of the way Johnny had scaled the great
southern wall.</p>

<p>Reaching the ridge, Quigley paused to rest, and
weighed the merits of the two approaches. He could
be as clever and cautious as the next man when he
felt that the occasion demanded it; and the events of
the last few days told him that such an occasion had
arrived. Easing the bandages, he chose the southern
course and led the way again.</p>

<p>"There's his smoke," grunted Purdy, trudging along
in the rear. "Wonder how much grub that ki-yote's
got?"</p>

<p>"Don't know; an' don't care much," replied Quigley.
"It don't make no difference. Th' time will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
come when he's <i>got</i> to come down, an' bein' there
when he does is our job. If I was plumb shore he
was workin' on his own hook my worries would simmer
down a whole lot; an' until I <i>am</i> shore, I ain't
overlookin' nothin'."</p>

<p>"You ain't got no business comin' out here with
an arm like that," growled Purdy. "Three of us are
enough."</p>

<p>"I ain't got no business bein' nowhere else," retorted
Quigley. "An' as long as yo're ridin' that
subject again, lemme tell you that from now on till we
get him, I'm goin' to stay right there. My eyes are
all right, an' my Colt arm is th' same as ever. Bend
low here an' foller my steps close&mdash;on th' jump,
<i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>Reaching the end of the wide valley they came to
a great widening of the lower levels, where the canyon
emerged from between the Buttes and became lost
in the great sink which surrounded the Twins. Quigley
knew the sink from former explorations, and he
chose ridges and draws without hesitation and kept
well hidden at all times from anyone up on the butte.
In order to continue in this security it was necessary
to go almost to the eastern wall of the sink in a wide
detour, and the chief unhesitatingly chose that route.</p>

<p>Because of an instinct born from years of woodcraft,
Quigley's eyes missed nothing. Had he been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
riding down Hastings' single street he unconsciously
would have observed every tin can, every old boot,
and his memory, automatically photographing them
with remarkable fidelity, would have filed the pictures
away for future reference. Crossing a sage hen's track
he unconsciously observed it minutely, and he could
have told quite an interesting and intimate tale of
what the bird had been doing.</p>

<p>Plunging into a deep gully, he swung up the opposite
slope on a diagonal, and stopped suddenly, his
busy mind instantly sidetracking its cogitations to take
care of a matter immediately under his eyes. Three
small stones lay, dark and damp, against the sun-dried,
whitish rock stratum which formed the surface of the
ridge. Above the level of his shoulders several green
twigs were well chewed, two of them bitten clean
off, and a dried lather still clung to them. Shoving
his elbows out from his side to check his companion,
he looked closely at both signs, and then, bending over,
hurried along the slope searching the ground and
swiftly disappeared around a bowlder. Purdy followed
and bent over beside him. In a small patch of
sand and clay which filled a hollow in the rock floor
was the print of a hoof, and extending in front of it
lay the imprint of the forward half of a moccasin.</p>

<p>Quigley glanced up quickly at his companion.
"Fresh made!" he grunted. "Leads away from th'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
butte. Might be two men, one of 'em ridln'. Wait
here, an' lay low!"</p>

<p>Going on a few steps he shook his head slowly and
disappeared around a thicket. Ahead of turn was a
wide streak of sand and gravel and he hurried to it.</p>

<p>"<i>Two</i> men on foot, leadin' a hoss!" he growled.
"Wish I had time to foller these tracks; but there's
no tellin' how far they go." He paused a moment in
indecision, tempted to go on, but shaking his head he
wheeled and ran back to Purdy, cursing the increased
throbbing of his arm.</p>

<p>"Purdy!" he whispered incisively; "somethin's
rotten! One cayuse; two men. Wait a minute!" and
he sent his thoughts racing over every possibility.
"They can be strangers that blundered through here;
or friends of Nelson's. If they was strangers, an'
passed th' Buttes, as that back trail indicates, they
wouldn't try to keep hidden, an' either Art or Frank
would 'a' seen them, an' follered them. If they was
friends of his&mdash;d&mdash;n it! Wish I had taken th' trouble
to hunt up th' tracks of that black cayuse some
place where they showed up plain an' deep!"</p>

<p>Purdy thoughtfully rubbed his head. "Mebby that
cayuse wandered down, an' th' boys led it off to hide
it."</p>

<p>"<i>Both</i> of 'em?" snapped Quigley. "One had to
stay on guard. An' they can't turn boots into mocca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>sins.
Cuss it! Why would innercent strangers wear
moccasins in this kind of country? They wouldn't,
unless they was up to some deviltry. Purdy, we got
a job on our hands. First, we'll see Art an' Frank&mdash;no
<i>we</i> won't: <i>I</i> will. You foller these tracks an' find
out what you can. Don't foller 'em longer than an
hour. We'll meet right here. If you hear three shots
so close together that they sound like a ripple, you
cut h&mdash;l-bent for th' ranch, by a roundabout way,"
and he was gone before Purdy could answer him.</p>

<p>Purdy ran forward, his gaze on the ground, and
every time the trail became lost on clean, hard rock,
he swore impatiently and ran in ever-widening circles
until he found it again. Suddenly he crouched low
and froze in his tracks. In an opening at the bottom
of a deep, heavily wooded draw lying just ahead of him
he caught sight of a black horse, saddled, cropping
grass. The animal threw up its head, looked at him,
flattened its ears and backed away, ready to bolt. And
under his eyes lay four pairs of moccasin prints, two
of them pointing back toward the Buttes.</p>

<p>"It's <i>his</i> bronc!" growled Purdy under his breath.
"How th' devil&mdash;!" Wild conjectures filed into
his mind in swift confusion, and, wrestling with them,
he wheeled sharply and dashed back the way he had
come, his Colt ready for action.</p>

<p>Quigley, calling into play every trick of woodcraft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
that he knew, kept on toward the Twin Buttes canyon,
silent, alert, never once leaving cover. The
smoke of the fire up on the butte was barely discernible
now and the smoke from the rustlers' fire at the
foot of the trail could not be seen at all. Eagerly he
scrutinized the tops of the two buttes, but in vain.</p>

<p>Working steadily forward with the caution of an
Indian, he followed and kept close to the eastern wall
of the sink until directly back of the place where the
trail guard should be, and in line with that and the
lower end of the trail. His progress now became slow,
and he exercised an infinite caution and patience. Cover
followed cover, and every few yards he stopped and
waited, his senses at the top pitch of their efficiency.
Drawing near the position used by him and his men
in guarding the mesa trail he passed within fifty feet
of Luke Tedrue, and neither knew of it. Had he gone
ten feet farther forward he would have died in his
tracks.</p>

<p>He stopped. It was now Art's or Frank's turn to
show some sign of life. Neither of them had any need
to remain quiet, and he knew that under such circumstances
a man is almost certain to make some kind of
a noise within a reasonable length of time.</p>

<p>The minutes passed in absolute silence, and finally
he could wait no longer, for each passing minute was
precious to him, and he silently backed away, to ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>proach
from another direction. As he crept past a
bowlder, avoiding every growing thing and every twig
or loose pebble, he glanced along a narrow opening
between some rocks and a thinning of the brush, and
saw two sock-covered feet, toes up. It took him a
long time to maneuver so that he could see enough of
the body to be sure of its identity, and when he was
sure he choked back a curse.</p>

<p>"Fleming!" he breathed. "Knifed through th'
throat! An' they took his pants an' left a pair of blue
ones. Nelson wore black! An' Frank, up there on th'
other butte&mdash;I can't get up <i>there</i> without bein' seen.
Frank, my boy; if yo're alive, you'll have to look out
for yoreself!"</p>

<p>As he crawled and wriggled and dashed back over
his trail his racing thoughts threw picture after picture
on his mental screen, until every possible solution
was eliminated and only the probable ones remained;
and from these two there loomed up one which almost
bore the stamp of certainty. The CL outfit, either
wholly or in part, had arrived on the scene, and even
now might be attacking the ranch-houses. Dashing
around a pinnacle of granite, he sped down the slope
of the draw where Purdy, behind a thicket, awaited
him.</p>

<p>"Here, Tom!" softly called the waiting man, arising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quick!" panted Quigley. "H&mdash;l's broke loose
with all th' gates open! What you find?"</p>

<p>"Nelson's bronc. Th' two men that led it cached
it in a draw an' went back again towards th' Buttes.
"What's up?"</p>

<p>"Everything, I reckon. Fleming's dead&mdash;knifed,"
panted Quigley, leading the way westward. "Frank&mdash;I
don't know&mdash;about him. Never&mdash;had a chance&mdash;Art
didn't. Good thing&mdash;I reckon we come&mdash;th'
way we did. There&mdash;ain't no tellin'&mdash;what we might
'a' run&mdash;up ag'in. D&mdash;n 'em! I'll never leave&mdash;th'
hills! Dead or&mdash;alive, I stays!"</p>

<p>"I've located here&mdash;permanent myself," growled
Purdy. "Fleming knifed, huh? Mebby&mdash;mebby
they're Injuns! Knife-play an' moccasins! I&mdash;betcha!"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n fool!" gritted Quigley savagely; and then,
remembering his companion's declaration of permanent
location, he relented. "He wasn't&mdash;scalped!"</p>

<p>"Apaches&mdash;don't scalp!" grunted Purdy doggedly.</p>

<p>"But they make&mdash;tracks, don't they?" blazed
Quigley. "I tell you&mdash;I know Injun tracks&mdash;like
I know my name. They're&mdash;white men!"</p>

"TWO IJUTS"</h2></div>


<p>Luke Tedrue brushed flies. Since a little after
dawn he had brushed them continually, insistently,
doggedly, with an enforced calmness and apathy
which only an iron, stubborn will made possible; and
had they suddenly desisted in their eager explorations
he would have kept on brushing from sheer force of
habit. But while his hands and arms were moving
mechanically, his mind was having an argument with
itself concerning his ears, and a vague uneasiness made
him restless.</p>

<p>He suspected that he had heard a sound, one which
only a moving body would have made; but it had been
so slight that he had not recognized it at the time,
and it was only through the persistent, indefatigable
urging of some subconscious sense that he was now
trying to force his memory to repeat it for him, to
give him a hold upon it that he might describe and
classify it. Exasperated, fretful, uneasy, he called
himself a fool with too zealous an imagination; but
he kept straining at his reluctant memory, trying to
force it to leap back and grasp the elusive impression.
Vexed and anxious, he at last wriggled back among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
bowlders which sheltered him, determined to prove
or disprove the haunting subconscious sense. It had
become maddening, a ghost he simply had to lay.</p>

<p>Realizing that the moving object is the more readily
seen, Luke moved slowly and with no regard for dignity;
and he proceeded, an inch at a time, upon his lean,
old stomach. Nothing was too small or insignificant
to escape his notice, for his eyes, close to the ground,
first took in the entire field of vision with one quick,
sweeping glance, and then, beginning with the more
distant objects, examined everything in sight as though
he had lost something of great value and of size infinitesimal.
Another few inches of slow, laborious
progress, and another searching scrutiny, his ears as
busy as his eyes. In half an hour he had covered ten
feet, and at the end of an hour he had made it twenty.
And then, as he glanced around to obtain a general
and preliminary view of a new vista, his eyes passed
over a little patch of sand, and instantly flashed back
to it, regarding it with an unwinking intentness.</p>

<p>He hitched forward again, more rapidly, and gained
three feet before he stopped to peer about him. At
last he came to the sand patch, which lay between a
bowlder and a clump of dry, dead, and rustly brush;
which accounted for its having a story to tell. It was
the only way a cautious man could have proceeded;
and the print of the heel of a hand and the five little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
dots where the tips of thumb and fingers had rested
was well to one side of it. Furthermore, there was
a smooth streak across it which contained two other
streaks along the outer edges of the first one. The
story was plain: a stomach, followed by two legs, had
been dragged across the little patch of sand.</p>

<p>Luke raised his educated eyes and looked around
him, but now his field of vision was considerably constricted,
for he paid attention only to those few spaces
in the brush and among the rocks which a clever man
would be likely to use; and being a clever man himself,
he unerringly picked certain openings and almost
instantly riveted his gaze on a sign: a toe print at his
left. Close to it was another, and the way in which
the sand had been pushed up told him that the first had
been made by a man crawling west; and the other
announced to him that it had been made by a man
moving east. Luke deduced that the same man, returning
over his own trail, had made the second as
well as the first.</p>

<p>Luke was relieved, and, havin' a safe trail to follow,
he pushed on rapidly but silently, soon reaching
the place where it ended; and in plain sight of him,
through the thin growth of brush, was Fleming's body.
One glance at it and Luke turned, following the trail
back as he had come; and an hour later, having learned
a great deal, he ran and crept, leaped and wriggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
up to the place where his friend lay and petulantly
cursed the flies.</p>

<p>"Ijut Number Two," said Luke pleasantly, "where
are you?"</p>

<p>"Talkin' to hisself again," grumbled a low voice
from the mysterious passages under a great, tumbled
mass of bowlders. "If a body meet a body, reachin'
for th' rye," continued the vexed voice, "whose treat
is it?"</p>

<p>"Depends on who can't keep still," answered Luke
brightly. "We are two ijuts," he said positively and
flatly.</p>

<p>"Well, I allus like a man that speaks his mind,
even if he <i>is</i> a liar," commented the mysterious voice.
"D&mdash;n these flies! I crawled in here to get rid of
'em; but they come right along. An' a little while
back I smelled a striped kitty-cat. I knowed what it
was because th' wind wasn't blowin' from yore direction."</p>

<p>"Cuss his impudence!" said Luke. "He takes me
for a wild flower! A rose, mebby. An' me comin'
out here to save his worthless life!"</p>

<p>"You didn't do nothin' of th' kind," contradicted
the sepulchral voice. "You come out here to practice
with Colonel Bowie! I can prove it before any
fool jury. D&mdash;n th' flies!"</p>

<p>"What flies?" innocently demanded Luke, his voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
suggesting a hot curiosity and a thirsty yearning for
knowledge.</p>

<p>"Time," said the other. "Time flies; an' I've had
these flies all th' time. It's time they flies away, to fly
back another day. You leave yours behind you, Cow
Face, if you visit me."</p>

<p>"Ain't got none; an' ain't seen none," replied Luke
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Twice a liar," observed Johnny pleasantly. "Why
don't you learn to speak th' truth sometimes? I'm
worried about yore soul."</p>

<p>"I'm worried about my belly an' my knees. They're
scraped clean, wrigglin' over rock."</p>

<p>"'Tain't possible; not at yore age," commented
Johnny. "Th' accumulations of years can't be got rid
of so easy, Old Timer."</p>

<p>"No wonder they chased him off th' Tin Cup,"
grinned Luke. "We are two ijuts."</p>

<p>"Listen to th' jackass," said Johnny. "Th' flies
that flew an' flied; th' flies that crawled an' died; th'
flies that buzzed an'&mdash;an'&mdash;holy h&mdash;l! Did you
<i>ever</i> see so many of 'em?"</p>

<p>"I done listened to th' jackass," grunted Luke.
"An' now I observes, gentle but firm: We are two
ijuts."</p>

<p>"We are one <i>ijut</i>," corrected Johnny. "You are
th' one. A soft answer turneth away wrath."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am an ijut; an' you are an ijut," replied Luke
with exaggerated patience. "That makes two; an' so
we are <i>two</i> ijuts."</p>

<p>"Can't you say nothin' else, One Ijut?" demanded
Johnny peevishly. "Yo're tiresome; yo're a repeater,
rim fire, Chestnut, model of 1873. I'm lazy by nature;
but doin' nothin' <i>all</i> th' time is hard work. It
don't set right. They have taken her to Georgia,
there to wear her life away. An' my neck aches from
lookin' up, an' holdin' my head out on th' end of it.
My stummick an' my elbows, my knees an' my toes
all, all ache. They are rock-galled. As she toils
'mid th' cotton an' th' corn."</p>

<p>"Cane," corrected Luke. "Yore appalin' ignerence
is discouragin'. We are two ijuts."</p>

<p>"All right; I quit," said Johnny wearily. "Have
it yore own way; mebby we are. But it could 'a' been
corn just as well as cane, anyhow. Why are we two
ijuts?"</p>

<p>"Because we are holdin' th' bag," said Luke sadly.</p>

<p>Johnny turned around and stuck his head out.
"Yes?" he inquired, with a rising inflection. "I'm
plumb insulted. I ain't never held no bag; not
never!"</p>

<p>"'Tain't never too late to learn," said Luke sorrowfully.
"Th' snipe has come, an' went; an' we're
<i>still</i> holdin' th' bag."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's fill it full of flies," suggested Johnny. "Say!
If you ain't seen no flies, how did all of them get
squashed on yore face?"</p>

<p>"Come flyin' out of yore cave just now an' bumped
into me full speed," replied Luke, grinning. "We
have been out-guessed, we have. They smelled us out.
We're two tenderfeet in a wild, bad camp. Somebody's
likely to hurt us, first thing you know. What
did you see when you wasn't killin' flies?"</p>

<p>"Th' sky, th' canyon, an' th' butte."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh; so did I. I saw th' butte, th' canyon,
an' th' sky. Then I moved an' saw hand prints, belly
prints, toe prints, knee prints, an' other kinds of
prints. Yore friends stacked th' deck on us an' dealt
'em from th' middle. Now what?"</p>

<p>"First, we eat," said Johnny, arising with alacrity.
"Then, mebby, we eat again. We drink an' we wash.
I'm near half as dirty as you. What have you found
out?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever see two calves, wobble-kneed, friskin'
around lookin' saucy an' full of h&mdash;l an' wisdom; but
actin' plumb foolish?"</p>

<p>"I shore did. I never saw no other kind, unless it
was sick. Stiff back, humped in defiance; tail tryin'
to stand up; stiff-laigged, when they didn't buckle unexpected;
jumpin' sideways, tryin' to butt, an' allus
hungry. I did, Old Timer; lots an' lots of times."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, them's us," sighed Luke. "You hold yore
trap an' listen while I speaks my piece. I saw them
signs, like I said. Th' cuss that made 'em sneaked
right up to my back door, went around th' side of my
house, stopped just in time for his health, backed off,
saw his friend's body, an' my pants, an' backed off some
more. Then he climbed up on two good feet an' made
toe prints plumb deep. He didn't run; no, ma'am; he
just telegraphed hisself; never stopped for nothin'.
He sped, he shot, he <i>moved</i>!"</p>

<p>"An' us two ijuts layin' out here in th' sun till we
was cussed near jerked meat!" growled Johnny. "I
call that blamed unpolite."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you we was two ijuts? When an older
man speaks you want to keep yore mouth shut an'
yore ear tabs open. Th' young bucks go out an' steal
th' horses an' lift th' scalps; but th' old fellers make
good talk around th' council fires. Stick <i>that</i> in yore
peace pipe an' smoke it. Might be good for your
health sometime."</p>

<p>"Yo're a purty spry scalper yoreself," admitted
Johnny. "Regular old he-whizzer; but you got no
morals, an' a very bad, disgustin' habit. I'm surprised
you didn't take scalps, too!"</p>

<p>"You let the Colonel alone," warned Luke. "Now,
that rustler is some he-whizzer hisself, an' he won't
need nobody to tell him what he saw. He's done told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
his tribe about that; an' bein' a stranger here I'm only
guessin'. Say what's on yore mind."</p>

<p>"Th' young buck will now talk at th' council fire,"
grinned Johnny. "Yo're right, for once. It wasn't th'
cook. I never saw a cook yet that could move around
so nobody could hear him. It wasn't Gates, because
he's wounded several; an' I don't think it was that
other feller, because somehow I ain't feverishly admirin'
his brains. That leaves Quigley; an' he ain't
no fool <i>all</i> th' time. I can see him beatin' hell an'
high-water to his three stone shacks, where his friends
are, an' where his guns, grub, clothes, an' other things
are. I can see four men lookin' out of four loopholes.
They are if they ain't jumped th' country; an' if they
has, we'll let 'em go.</p>

<p>"Takin' a new, fresh holt, I'd say that they don't
know that we'd let 'em go; an' they don't know how
many we are, or where all of us are located. They
don't aim to lead us a chase; that is, mebby they don't.
Them shacks are shore strong; an' they don't know
how far they might get if they run for it. 'Tain't like
open country&mdash;they got just four places to ride out
of that sink an' they all can be easy guarded."</p>

<p>"They won't come out th' way they went in," said
Luke. "That would be risky an' foolish; so they's
only three places left."</p>

<p>"A wise man never does what he ought to do,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
said Johnny. "Now, I'll bet they are either in them
stone houses, or some place else," he grinned. "Th'
only way, after all, to see a good man's hand, is to call
it. Me an' you, bein' amazin' curious, will do just that.
If they're in them houses they'll be expectin' us; they'll
turn th' 'Welcome' sign to th' wall an' smoke up them
loopholes. Don't interrupt me yet! I'm long-winded
an' hard to stop. Th' question is: Are you primed to
wrastle this thing out, just me an' you, or shall I watch
'em while you go back to th' CL for help? That&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> interrupt!" snorted Luke heatedly. "If it
wasn't that yo're only a fool infant, d&mdash;&mdash;d if I wouldn't
fan yore saddle end! I ain't never yelled for help
when it wasn't needed; an' lots of times when it was
needed I forgot to yell. Too busy, mebby. You've
been running things with a high hand out here, an'
yore head reminds me of th' head of a cow bit by a
snake. It's swelled scandalous. I'm goin' to show
you how to get four men out of them loopholes. Bein'
young an' green, you'd likely want to crawl in an' pull
'em out. But me, bein' wise, will use brains, an' more
brains. I can make a cat skin itself."</p>

<p>"You want to be plumb shore that it ain't one of
them striped kitties&mdash;they look a lot alike in a poor
light; an' that entrance canyon is shore poor light. I
reckon we won't eat, yet. We better rustle for their
ranch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Logan wants to know them facts that he sent
us after," growled Luke regretfully.</p>

<p>"We ain't got 'em; an' we can't get 'em. Them fellers
won't do no rustlin' now, so how can we trail 'em?
They're too cussed busy lookin' out for their skins
about now. An' only two of 'em ain't wounded; Purdy
an' th' cook."</p>

<p>"How many cows they got?"</p>

<p>"Near two hundred."</p>

<p>"Holy Jumpin' Jerusalem!" snorted Luke. "We're
lucky that we still got th' ranch-house an' th' river!"</p>

<p>"We're wastin' time," growled Johnny, impatiently.
"There's no telling what they're doin'. Come on.
Bein' desperate, mebby they're roundin' up to make a
drive. Come on!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was past mid-afternoon when the two punchers
looked down into the QE valley and found relief at the
sight of the cows lazily feeding. They were scattered
all over the range and both men knew that no attempt
had been made to round them up.</p>

<p>Going down the blind-canyon trail, they crossed the
range, climbed the opposite cliff and finally stopped in
front of the stone houses. A gun barrel projected
from a loophole in the south wall of the house nearest
the canyon, and four saddled horses were in the smaller
corral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"There they are," said Johnny. A bullet stirred his
hair and he drew back from the rim. "We got to get
'em. Start skinnin' that cat, Old Timer."</p>

<p>"It'll shore take a lot of skinnin'," growled Luke.</p>

<p>"Not if we uses 'brains an' more brains,'" jeered
Johnny. "Th' young buck will now be heard shootin'
off his mouth at th' council fire; an' you listen close,
One Ijut!"</p>

<p>"Have yore say," said Luke, covering a loophole
which showed signs of activity.</p>

<p>"We've got to move fast, before they learn that
there's only two of us," said Johnny. "When them
houses was built they was laid out with th' idea of men
bein' in <i>all</i> of 'em; an' they'd be cussed hard to lick,
then. But I reckon they're all in that one house. There
ain't men enough to hold 'em all; an' so they favored th'
one near th' canyon. We got to keep that door shut so
they can't get out an' away. I'll do that after dark;
an' I'll stampede them cayuses. That leaves 'em no
chance to make a dash an' ride for it. Now you see that
little trickle of water flowin' under th' houses? That's
their water supply; I know something about that crick;
but that's another job for th' dark. Take a look over
there, where it turns. See that dirt bank, on th' bend?
That's where they turned it out of its course an' sent
it flowin' in th' ditch leadin' to th' houses. Do you
reckon you could cut that bank with Colonel Bowie an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
throw a little dam across th' ditch? 'Tain't wide; only
a couple of feet. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Luke fired, and grunted regretfully. "Missed him,
d&mdash;n it!" he swore, reloading. "Gettin' so you can
find work for my knife, huh?" he chuckled. "Not
bein' blind, I see th' bank an' th' bend. An' if I can't
turn that water back th' way it used to go, I'll fold up
an' die. This is like old times. You must 'a' had a
real elegant, bang-up time out here, crawlin' around an'
raisin' h&mdash;l with 'em. What a grand place for th'
Colonel! I shore missed a lot; but I'm here now, an'
with both feet! Sing yore song; I'm listenin'."</p>

<p>"It's sung," grinned Johnny; "an' now we got to
dance."</p>

<p>"I ain't as spry as I used to be," grunted Luke; "so
I'll have to make them fellers do th' dancin'."</p>

"ALL BUT TH' COWS"</h2></div>


<p>Gates, the wounded, tossed restlessly in his bunk,
and finally rolled over and faced the dark room.
"Never was so wide awake in my life," he grumbled.
"Been settin' around too much lately. If I
wanted to stay awake I'd be as sleepy as th' devil."</p>

<p>"Better try it again," counseled Quigley, shifting
from his loophole. "You don't want to be sleepy
tomorrow when yo're on guard."</p>

<p>"Tom," said Gates, ignoring the advice. "I've been
doin' some thinkin'. A feller does a lot of thinkin'
when he can't sleep. We made a couple of mistakes,
holin' up like this. In th' first place, if we had to hole
up, we should 'a' occupied <i>both</i> end houses, 'stead of
only one. This way, they can walk right up to within
twenty feet of us, use th' cook shack, th' grub in th'
store-house, an' them store-house loopholes, which is
worse. If we had both end houses, two men in each,
they couldn't get anywhere close to us except along th'
crick an' up on th' cliff."</p>

<p>"Yes; I reckon so," said Quigley. "'Tain't too late
yet, mebby. I didn't like th' idea of splittin' up our
forces. As far as grub is concerned, we're near as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
off that way as we are in our water supply. We got
grub in here for two months, an' plenty of cartridges
if we don't get reckless with 'em. Of course, I wish
that other case was in here, too; it'd give us another
thousand rounds for th' rifles; but I ain't worryin' none
about that. An' I'm purty near shore, now, that there's
only two of 'em fightin' us: Nelson an' that Tedrue,
judgin' from th' knife-work."</p>

<p>"That's th' way I figger it," agreed Gates. "An'
that's why we shouldn't 'a' holed up like this. Me ah'
th' cook could 'a' held this house, while you an' Purdy
was on th' outside stalkin' 'em. Any man that can stalk
like you can is plumb wastin' his time cooped up in
here; an' you could 'a' made things sizzlin' hot for
them two fellers, good as they are. This way, they've
got us located, an' they only have to look for trouble
in front of 'em. They know where to expect it all th'
time. It was a big mistake."</p>

<p>"Mebby," grunted Quigley. "We'll try it in here
tonight an' tomorrow, an' then if we don't have no
luck, I'll fade away tomorrow night an' give 'em a
taste of Injun fightin'. There ain't no moon this week,
so we can pick our time to suit ourselves."</p>

<p>Purdy leaned his rifle against the wall and groped
for the water bucket. "I'll make a try for that extra
case of cartridges right now, if you say th' word," he
offered. "Huh! We shore drink a lot of water," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
grunted. "I filled this pail before sundown, an' it's
near empty now. Too much bacon, I reckon."</p>

<p>Quigley laughed softly. "Water is one thing we
don't have to worry about at all. That ditch was a
great idea."</p>

<p>Could he have followed the ditch in the dark he
would have been surprised to have seen the dam
across it, and the cut through the artificial bank, where
Luke Tedrue and a commandeered shovel had released
the little stream and let it flow to Rustler Creek along
its old, original bed down a shallow gully. That was
Johnny's idea; but after the old scout had carried it
out, he had an idea of his own which pleased him
greatly, and he acted upon it without loss of time.</p>

<p>The cook stirred and sat up, feeling for his pipe,
which was always his first act upon awakening. He
grunted sleepily and sat on the edge of his bunk.
"This is a whole lot like bein' in jail," he yawned.
"An' what do you think? I dreamed that somebody
had just tapped a keg of beer, an' when I sidled over
to see that none of it was wasted, why I woke up!
That's allus my luck. How soon'll it be daylight?
That dream made me thirsty. Where's that cussed
water bucket?"</p>

<p>"Right where it was th' last time you found it,"
grinned Purdy. "It ain't moved none at all."</p>

<p>"Yo're right, it ain't," grumbled the cook, scraping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
a tin cup across the bottom of the pail. "It never does
unless <i>I</i> do it. I'll bet four bits that I've filled it every
time it got empty; an' I'll bet four bits more that I ain't
goin' to fill it <i>this</i> time," he chuckled. "There's just
enough here for me. Th' next gent that wants a drink
will be observed bendin' over th' trapdoor an' fillin'
it for hisself. Here's how! An' d&mdash;n th' beer what
only comes in dreams."</p>

<p>Gates crawled out of his bunk and limped to the
bucket. "Get out of my way," he growled. "Speakin'
of beer started my throat to raspin'. No you don't;
not a-tall," he grumbled, pushing the cook aside. "I'll
wait on myself, slugs or <i>no</i> slugs. I ain't no teethin'
infant, even if I <i>am</i> full of holes." He crossed to the
trapdoor and fumbled around in the dark. "Huh!
I knowed it couldn't get far away. I've been kneelin'
on it all th' time!"</p>

<p>"Better lemme do that," offered the cook, advancing.</p>

<p>"Better yore grandmother," said Gates. "No,
ma'am; you put on too many airs, you do." He raised
the door. "You might strain yore delicate back,
Cookie, old boss. An' anyhow, I'm aimin' to spite
you for that unnecessary remark about openin' a keg
of beer. This ain't no time to talk about things like
that." He leaned down and swung the bucket, but
there was no splash, only a rattling, tinny thump.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
"Why," said his muffled voice, "there ain't no water
here! Mebby I missed it. Why, d&mdash;n it, there ain't
no water here a-tall! What th'&mdash;" His voice ceased
abruptly and a solid, muffled thump came up through
the opening.</p>

<p>The cook, leaning forward in the position he had
frozen in when he had grasped the significance of the
sound of the striking bucket, moved toward the trap,
feeling before him. He touched the edge of the opening
and swiftly felt around it. Gates was not there.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n it, he's fell in!" he muttered. "It wasn't no
job for a wounded man like him, bendin' over that
way. Here, Purdy!" he called "Gimme a hand with
Ben. He plumb keeled over an' fell in." He reached
down impatiently and felt around. "H&mdash;l!" he
yelled as an up-thrust hand gripped him, jerked him off
his balance and pulled him down through the opening.
"Look out, fellers!" he shouted.</p>

<p>A second thump, softer than the first, ended the cry,
and Purdy, leaping forward, slammed shut the trap
and bolted it. "More knife-work!" he gritted, pale
with rage. Arising, he leaped toward the cabin door,
yanked it open and dashed along the house, staggering
as a finger of flame spurted from a loophole in the wall
of the store-house, but recovered his balance and turned
the corner. As he did so he caught sight of a thickening
in the darkness, which moved swiftly and silently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
along the ditch, and he fired at it. Something whizzed
past his neck and rang out, sharp and clear as a bell, on
the end wall of the house. He answered it with another
shot and saw the blot stagger and fall.</p>

<p>From the ditch came a spurt of fire and Purdy
plunged forward, firing as he fell. Another shot answered
him and again he fired, but with a weak and
shaking hand. Then from a loophole behind him
Quigley's rifle poked out and sent shot after shot along
the ditch, firing on a gamble.</p>

<p>As the rifle spoke, a shadow flitted past the corner
of the store-house, passed swiftly and silently across
the space between the two houses and plunged through
the open door of the rustlers' stronghold. It tripped
over a box and sprawled headlong just as Quigley
wheeled and sent a bullet through the space Johnny had
occupied an instant before.</p>

<p>Leaping to his feet, Johnny hurled himself upon the
rustler, wrenched the rifle loose and gripped the
owner's throat. Plunging, heaving, straining, they
thrashed around the room, smashing into bunks, breaking
dishes; hammering, gouging, biting, choking, they
bumped into the door, plunged through the opening
and carried the struggle out under the sky.</p>

<p>Quigley, his face purple and his eyes popping out,
almost senseless on his feet, and fighting from instinct,
managed to break the grip on his throat and showered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
blows on his enemy's face. Sinking his teeth in Johnny's
upper arm, he got both of his hands around Johnny's
throat and closed his grip with all his weakened
strength.</p>

<p>Across the yard they reeled, bumped into the corral
and along it, following the slope of the ground without
thought. Johnny, suffocating, thrust the heel of his
right hand against his enemy's nose and pushed upward
and back, while his left hand, leaving the gripping
fingers around his throat, smashed heavily into Quigley's
stomach. The hands relaxed, loosened their grip
and fell away, and before they could regain their hold,
Johnny's chin settled firmly against his chest and protected
his windpipe. Just in time he caught Quigley's
gun hand and tore the Colt out of it, whereupon Quigley
hammered his face with both hands. Shoving,
wrestling, reeling, they came to the edge of the ravine
through which flowed Rustler Creek, and, plunging
over the steep bank, rolled to the bottom and stopped
in the mud and water of the creek itself, where they
fought lying down, each trying desperately to remain
on top.</p>

<p>Quigley's hand brushed one of Johnny's guns,
gripped it, drew it out and shoved the muzzle against
his enemy's side. As he pulled the trigger Johnny
writhed swiftly and turned the muzzle away. Squirming
on top, he again turned the muzzle away as Quig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>ley
fired the second time. At the roar of the shot the
rustler grunted and grew suddenly limp.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Logan pushed back from the dinner table and
glanced out of the window. Shouting an exclamation
he leaped for the door, the rest of the outfit piling pell-mell
at his heels.</p>

<p>A black horse, carrying double, stopped near the
door and eager hands caught Luke Tedrue as he fell
from Pepper's back. Johnny, covered with mud, dust,
blood, and powder grime, his clothes torn into shreds
and his face a battered mass of red and black and blue
flesh, swayed slightly, grasped the saddle horn with
both hands and sat stiffly erect again.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" shouted Logan, jumping to him.
"What th' h&mdash;l's up?"</p>

<p>"Rustlin'," muttered Johnny. "Luke's brains got
foundered in th' head an' he pulled three of 'em out
of a hole; but I made Quigley skin th' cat."</p>

<p>"Are they <i>all</i> gone under?" yelled Logan incredulously.</p>

<p>"All but th' cows," sighed Johnny, and strong arms
caught him as he fell.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
